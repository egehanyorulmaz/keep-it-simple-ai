"I would say that compulsory is too strong. If we don't have to get any more proofs of the benefic effects of education abroad, there are some reasons that make me be unsure about how to answer the question. First of all, education abroad costs a lot of money and making it compulsory would oblige the state to find a way to offer it for students who could not pay it otherwise. Secondly, we know education abroad is beneficial if it lasts some time. A week would not be enough. That creates several problems, like for families who would not want to be separated a long time or, again, the question of money. Thirdly, even if we live in a capitalist and multinational world, some people just want to live in the country they were born in, and we should'nt oblige them to move out for some time. Nevertheless, studying abroad brings some advantages. In the first place, people are more open-minded after living in a foreign world, which is always a good thing. Especially in the situation we know today. Moreover, learning a new language offers two benefits : first, it helps  to structurate the way we think, as some languages are totally different from our mother language. Secondly, it is good for people who want to explore the world and its beauty to know other languages. Finally, it helps to get some independacy by learning to live in an other situation than the one whe have always known. For all those reasons, I would say that if the problems making foreign study were solved, it would be a good thing. ",B2,0298.xml

"First, I don't think that study abroad should be a compulsory part of the education because nothing should be compulsory. Our eduction is one of the most important part of our life, so we should all be free to choose what is best for us. On the other hand, nobody can't say that study abroad won't be useful for our professional life. This kind of experience should be proposed to everybody like a normal choice between differents things in order to develop our education level. Finaly, it's better to let the choice to the children to choose if they want to develop their skills or not. The compulsory nature of the thing can transform study abroad into something boring while the main goal is to promote the language and to help people to develop new skills. ",B2,0307.xml
"I think it's better to have a enjoyable job. Why ? Because humans need to have a purpuse in their lives, and if they don't do anything, they'll get boring. Works stimulate creativity, and if this job is enjoyable to one personn, that one'll be happier and more productive than if the job is unpleasant to him.And, if this job is enjoyable to that personn, and if his salary allow him to live, I think this personn would rather have this enjoyable job than just making money, because happinness is not only a matter of money.

"Today, if you do not take care of your diet, you get sick. Eating wholesome, fresh and simple food is basicly the best way to preserve your health. The best proof is the incredible number of people taking tablets to control their cholesterol level. Now, it is happening to people before their 40th ! There is no secret, it is written on every single box of prepared food in any supermarket : hydrogenated fat, E numbers, salt... And so many other things that we just wonder if they are really edible and necessary. Another problem is the increase of all the allergy : lactose and dairy products, soy, arachid, nuts, eggs, gluten, the list is long. A cow which is living in the moutain produces 20 litres of milk every day. A cow in a kind of factory dedicated to produce as much milk as possible will give 100 litres every day. This cannot be the same milk. You are what you eat. Keeping a good health is a challenge of every day. Wake up a bit earlier and take time to start your day with a fresh fruit. Which means that you must have some in your fridge. Follow the season, be simple. Eat a real breakfast which will feed you untl lunch time. Prepare your own lunch with meat or fish or eggs, some pasta, rice or patatoes and the most important, plenty of vegetables, do not buy food like frozen meal or some of the junk food you can find at every corner of each street, they are all poison for your arteries. In the afternoon, if you like something, why not an apple ? Easy to transport and to keep with you. A light meal like a fresh bowl of soup with a dish of varieted mixed salad it the best meal you can eat for you dinner. If you can take the time to go in a special shop which sells organic food, you will discover the real taste of good food and this will keep you in good health for a long life. For the drink, break donw on alcohol and do not forget that the body needs water. Avoid lemonade and keep a good glass of wine only occasionaly. Do not let industrial food ruin your health !

"I'm note sure that a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. In fact, I don't think that some factors are more important than some others. It's the combination of them that makes it important. For example, just eating more vegetables and less greasy stuff doesn't contribute that much to a healthier life, even though it might a little. But if you are careful of what you eat and you do some sport regularly, then of course it's better than just having a balanced diet. Besides, eating ""bad food"" can sometimes help having a healthy life. If you keep yourself from eating things that you love, like chocolate or hamburgers, you will be less happy and you well end up having difficulties to keep doing the diet, while if you indulge yourself some sweets from time to time, it will be easier to you to resist the rest of the time. Also, having a healthy life is not just about having a good physical condition, even though it helps. It's also about feeling well in one's mind. What is the point of eating well, doing sports, being thin, etc. if your constantly sad? Doing stuff that you like, seeing people that you love like your friends and family... this kind of things also contribute to a healthy life. As they say: ""A healthy mind in a healthy body"".

Last summer I attended to a great music festival near Namur in Belgium. This festival took place in a small village so it was difficult to reach by car and a little bit disturbing for people living around. Nevertheless there were no complaining from those people. As I said it was a music festival but it had way more goals than just making discover little groups from the places around. For example one of the main line was to make people aware about the pollution made by such a big event. The association of having fun and taking care of the environnement really brought me joy all over the festival. ,B1,0138.xml
"It was two years ago... I went in India with three of my friends, it was very hot. We saw a lot of palace, we visited a nature reserve but weren't see tigers.

We had a lot of chance thanks to the indian friend of my friend who showed us his country! ",A2,0474.xml
"How to improve the environment ? It seems to me that there are currently many climate problem on Earth. That is why I would give you some advice that cannot immediatly change the environmental issue but it should improve our surrounding. First, there is tendency to believe that a small cigarette butt do not pollute. However, many searchers concluded that it takes 1 year to disintagrate. Second, as it can be seen, western companies move their buildings or their industry to the Third Wolrd. My advice would be to buy local products because it avoids the shift of all the product in our courntry. Moreover, big companies generally do not respect the environment standards and they exploit children like Nike or Gap. To conclude, do not be a foe of your environment. For me, it is easy to throw waste product in a garbage and also to buy local products. That are my advices to improve our environment on a limited scale. ",B2,0312.xml
"I really want to study abroad but I don't think forcing people to do it is a good idea. According to me, this must be a personnel decision. If somebody chooses to do such a projet, he will be more motivated to do it. Moreover, this might be hard for some people to go living some times far from them friends and family. These people might not enjoy the experience and benefit from it. This could be worse than anything else. Furthermore, study abroad costs money: you have to find an appartement, buying furniture, sometime the cost of living in the host country is also higher, etc. Who gonna paid for this? Is it the student or his parents who could perhaps not afford? Or is it a new hole in the state budget? I really think money should be invested in a better place to improve education or to help people in an other way. ",B2,0306.xml

"The best book - not necessary the easiest - that I  have read is probably  ""A la recherche du temps perdu"" by Marcel Proust. Each knows the inimitable style of the autor who plays with all nuances of de French language. But it is overall by the description of the society  and de character that this book is remarquable. The autor observes with a great perspicacity a part of de society of this end of 19th century. He is  part of this but, at de same time, he keeps a distance with it. So, his narration looks at once well documented and objective. Besides, it is often very humorous. ",B1,0514.xml
"If I had 1 million euros, I would stop looking for a job and i would create my own company. I'm too scared to do it without already having all that money because I'm not a big risk taker and I don't want to put myself into money troubles at this young age if it didn't work. But the idea of creating something, of giving people a job, adding value to the society is something that I love. ",B1,0528.xml
"Studying abroad is a good way to broad our horizons and could therefore be part of education. But it can also be not as good for the students as we think.Therefore, I will explain my arguments in favor of studying abroad. First, international education provides different languages to the students. Indeed, they will be able to convers in English and others languages. It can be also a good oportunity to put in practice their lessons and on a resume, it can be very interesting. Secondly, I would say that study abroad is a perfect oportunity to keep a open mind. In fact, with a international experience, students will have another academic point of vue and listening to other teachers during a short time can be very usefull. Moreover, on a extra-ademic point of view, studying in a other country for a few months, during a exchange program Erasmus for example, can also be benefic, students will make a lot of new friends and they will also be more independent. As a conclusion, even if this program can be difficult and needs a lot of courage, I think that studying abroad needs to be a part of education thanks to all those benefits. ",B2,0299.xml
"Three years ago, I travelled with my friends's group in Easthern Europe. More precisely, in Romenia, Hungaria and Serbia. First, we arrived in Belgrad which is the capital city of Serbia.

"Next, is the memory of the best holiday I had in the past few years.

"I think the most important is to have a enjoyable job, because when you enjoy something you feel better than when you only make money with your work. But i think that you can do both in the same time, with the priority of enjoying to do a job that you really like. When you do a job that you like, you have less limit, at some point, and you can make a better job than if you don't like what you are doing. When you do a job that you like, your work will be better because you want it to be the most perfect in your ""opinion"", you can feel being satify by doing it well. Even if you're not your own boss, if you like what you're doing it will be shown in the results. When you're doing a job only for money, you lack interst on it and you're only doing what you're asking to do, without real efforts. It's like doing it like a robot, the work will be done but they won't be any special effort from you. At the end, i think the results won't be the same if you enjoy what you're doing or not.

"In my opinion having an enjoyable job is more important than making a lot of money. In fact, people are much more productive if they are doing a job that they really like! Morover, havinga good job make you be a peron with good ethics. Finally, money can't be the main goal of life and will never compete with satisfaction at work. Actually, money can't be cure of the unhapiness of a person. To conclude, as stated by Benjamin Franklin, ""Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. The more a man has, the more ha wants. Instead of filling a vaccum, it makes one"". ",B2,0310.xml

"In my opinion, study abroad sould be highly recommended but not a compulsory part of education. To live abroad is indeed an extraordinary human experience : the student is discovering another way of life, can meet any kind of people and studies the language of the country such as it is really spoken. Thanks of his efforts of adaptation, he is certainly going to gain in maturity and could enrich his curriculum vitae. So he'll increase his chances to find an employment. But such a stay is expensive even if a subsidy is received.Someone can also be afraid to leave alone and can be destabilized by a failure.

"Social networks are of common use to day. They allow us to find information about people we will meet, to recover a lost email or address of a classmate and to provide information about your own job or hobby. This makes relations between people more efficient than in the past. Social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn will not suppress or reduce the direct contacts between people as they need to meet to get confidence in their relationship. Social networks will improve the quality of the relation between people as they reinforce the knowledge of the profiles of persons. An impact of this could be an increase of the number of people you will know and an indirect effect could be that it is probably more difficult to keep relations with a large amount of contacts and that they could tend to be more superficial. A problem could be the update of the information as platforms for social networks are more and more numerous and that the user has difficulties to remember all sites where she/he appears.

"First of all, in my opinion, every human being have a right to privacy. The fact that some people are famous makes it hard, but they still should be treated with respect for their private lives. It is up to us and to them to respect everyone's rights and liberties. Indeed, one example of an artist who decided not to be famous, in order to live ""normally"", is Sia. Even if at the beginning of her carrier she was showing her face to the cameras, she is now hiding her face with a mask at every single interview and live show in which she sings. In a former interview, she said that she didn't want to be recognised everywhere or criticized for what she looks like. She just wants to be appreciated for her music. On the other side, some artists weren't able to handle their famous side. Recently, a documentary about Amy Winehouse's life came out, and showed very well how she felt oppressed by the paparazzis. She was litterally stalked by them. However, there is not only one explanation for how she sadly ended, I personally think the fact that she couldn't handle her fame, was a part of her miserability. An other example is the scandal over nude pictures, in which a lot of famous people were involved. Indeed, some hackers decided to get inside the ""Cloud"" (an application on the Iphone) of famous personalities and post the pictures they found on the internet. Some stars like Jennifer Lawrence had nude pictures on it, from when she had a british boyfriend, while living in America. She said she had those because she wanted to maintain seduction between them rather than he would have cheated on her. She also said that noone is allowed to show and use her intimacy like that and that it should be considered as an abuse. That's why I think nowadays we live in a society in which people can't help but try to go inside the private life of others, and it's not ok. I believe it's a lack of education and we should all behave respectfully. The paparazzis would rather gain money over destoying lives of celebrities and it's a shame. ",C1,0675.xml

The advice I would give to help the environment is to be more efficient with our technology. We use more and more electricity that comes from different ways like nuclear centrals way too much. If we want to help the environment we must use more green energy that comes from other ressources. Why not use the wind energy or the solar one? We live in a democracy that allows us to vote and what we can do is to vote for a politician that thinks green. It's maybe a small step but we will go forward if all of us do the same. We need to act and to think right now because our time has come to change our world. The global warming will stop and this is what we have to aim. ,B2,0305.xml
"The problem of the environment's pollution is one of the most common issue that the humanity need to sort out. As a matter of fact, a lot of conventions through the world establish different measures to reduce durably the different kind of emissions and to reduce the waste of the energy. First of all, the main advice I want to give is to adapt our lifestyle in order to decrease the pollution. I think it will be a very difficult to change the mentality of the people but with the lack of ressources and the global warming and we will be forced to do it very soon . Everybody need to rethink their habits and manage to figure out which one consumes a lot and will be not so useful than that. Several habits need to be changed like for instance, not using the big toilet flushing or limiting our time show to 15 minutes maximum. To conclude, we need to be responsible to our environment. Therefor we have to change our lifestyle even if we lose a bit of comfort. ",B2,0311.xml
"The word ""environment"" is an important one. Indeed we can think about loads of different environments such as political or demographic for example. However, because of the recent facts in our country, I would like to write about the political environment which is important in this fight against the terrorism. I truly believe that the power is in the hand of our politicians and they have to find the magic bullet. I am completely ashamed to say it and I am in the misunderstanding about this. In my opinion, the only way to manage this war is to have boots on the ground, where the islamic state is located. They have to show how we are determinated and that we won't get ourselves ripped off. ",B2,0339.xml

What if you have a job you hate to do, but you win a lot of money ? Money is a good thing for a better life, that' true. But then you have to choose : do you want to be depressed to get up everyday, but can buy more things, or do you prefer to have nice days and can be happy even if you own less ? Good paid job is also often a job which asks a lot of time. Money, but no time to use it ?! In my point of view, an enjoyable job is essential in a life. But not all people have this chance.

"There are several factors that contribute to a healthy life. Among them, we can think about balanced diet, sport, healty behaviors (no drug consumption for example). We could organise these factors as ""personnal factors"", as these behaviors depend on one's will. But, are there others contribution to an healthy life? We could analyse the environnement where the subject lives. The air quality, the water sanity, the noise, all of these factors will have an impact on the life of a person. These are ""external factors"", that do not depend on the subject's will. A smart reader may infer that a personnal factor of a person can be an external factor of another: the smoke of someone decreases the quality of the air repired by another person, as a dummy example. To answer the question, it is difficult to guess what is the most important factor. First, we just saw that a factor for someone is, in fact, another factor for someone else: it is thus difficult to isolate a factor. Second, we must be able to measure a magnitude of the impact of a factor on the healthyness of the life. The noise generated by an airport will impact more people living close to the airport and badly affect their quality of life but, for people living in calm suburbs, the most important factor might be the diet. We can quickly sum up our point stating that there is no thing such as ""most important factor"" because that depends on the studied subject and its environnement. The notion is not universal. But we can regroup people in population affected the same way by a same kind of factor. That indicates us that, for example, a government that would build a program exclusively on balanced diet will not increase the quality of life of the whole population and would be wise studying all the factors, either personnal and external.

"Everyone agrees that good food is important for your body and for your health. So how does it come that people seem to eat less and less healthy food? Eating is one of the vital needs you fully have control over. Theoretically, everyone could choose what, when and how to eat. But not everyone has the ability to do so, and this leads to important differences between people who succeed in taking care of their diet, and people who don't want or can't afford good eating because of their rhythm of life, their personal choices or because of financial aspects. Unfortunately, food is not the top priority in an economy-driven world. As a consequence, too many people cannot afford good and healthy meals, and those who can from a financial point of view generally do not have sufficient time to allow to enjoy it. Economical factors also lead food producers to favor profit over quality at all levels of the food production chain. ",C1,0670.xml

On the one hand, you need to have a job you like because otherwise you won't work with pleasure and feel happy to go to your workplace or even try to do your best to make a good job.

But we must be aware of the fact that meeting face to face is often the best way to communicate, especially if we want to be understood avoiding possible misunderstandings. In facts, when we communicate in writing we cannot see the facial expressions and ear the emotions in the voice of our friend and the message looses part of its power and its signification. Moreover, if we only speak to our friends through social networks and never make efforts in order to meet them, our friendship becomes less strong. They will feel like you are not really there for them and that the relationship is not so important. In conclusion, social networks don't better our friendships if we only speak to our friends through them and never meet. ",C1,0666.xml

"If we speak about friendship, social networks are a good thing to stay up to date about your friend's lifes. When it comes to relationships (man and woman) then it can be destroying if you do open yourself too much online. For example the teenagers nowadays are posting everything they do on social networls and they end up hurt by people constantly judging them. It is also a way to be close to people in a way we may judge inapropriate: we send hearts, kisses, photos, intimacy so easy that we do not make a difference between a boyfriend/girlfriend and close friends. It is the same for adults. If you are jealous and you see your wife or husband making likes or comments on other girls/boys pictures like ""amazing, you look pretty"". How destructive can this be? I am married for 2 years and in a relationship for a bit longer than that and we are both using social networks. But we keep the big private things for us (conversations, disputes, private escapes,...) We own our relationship and leave a part of us on social media to keep our families up to date because they do not live in the smae countries as us. So we decided to use social networks as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Skype... as a way to connect with our families. We know what happens in their life, they know we are fine and we can call and get news anytime we want. ",C1,0673.xml

"I don't think an exchange should be compulsory. Some people are just not interested in going abroad. They feel good in belgium, they don't want or they are scared to go abroad, or some don't have the mooney to do so, even with scolarship. Some are afraid to be away from their lover(s) too. Of course it's a wonderful experience and it's great that we have the opportunity to do it. Maybe it'll even better if the process that is necessary to follow to go on exchange be better organised. I personnally feel aggrieved, comparing to other students, by a misinformation. Not a single person in the organisation did anything to correct that wrong information even if they nearly all knew. Anyway, I don't think it should be compulsory. It should be thought-out to improve the procedure every year. And we could have better language courses and more level-based division of group class (maybe interfaculty too ?). As well as a wider choice of languages in our basic BAC program, as they have in ULB. ",B2,0277.xml
"In my opinion, having an interesting job is way more important than making a lot of money. The first reason is that having a boring or a stressing job can lead to psychological deases such as bore-outs or burn-outs. A bd work can ruin one's health and there's no way it's worth it. Second, I think having a nice and interesting job can more enriching than money. Learning new things, meeting inspiring people, going beyond your limits are better reasons to get up in the morning than getting rich. Even though everyone needs money, this shouldn't be the factor that makes someone choose a job. ",B2,0288.xml

"A the matter of fact, I'd prefer have both. But, if I really have to choose I think that the first option is the best. Indeed, have an enjoyable job has also a side effect about money (I mean: not only about the wage). I you are happy at work yo're more healthy (so, you don't need of physicians an medicines) and to achieve yourself through a ""second life"" (like holydays or others) is less important. On the other hand, I you just make money, without any interest for your job, you're spending the third part of you're life (and perhaps the half if you consider that to sleep is also loosing time) in a kind of black hale. Actualy, money can't buy happiness ..and life spand. ",B2,0589.xml

"The best book I've ever read was ""The help"".  I heard a lot of positive critiscisms about this novel and now I'm thinking the same way about this book. That's why, I have read at least five times. I'm immersed in this book and the private lives of the citizens of 1960s Jackson. The novel shows the segregation between white and black. All the white people are racists.They treat the black maids poorly. They think that's they are stupids and inferior. This difference between race and the fact of slavery is mentioned several times shows us a reality that we can't ignore. ",B1,0576.xml

"If eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for healthy life it would be too easy! First of all it is diffcult to know how to reach a balanced diet ; indeed, most of food products are gentetically modified and grow in artificial conditions. Then to the other hand, what is important or not for a human body is completly linked to the subject and we might not find someting equally important for two different bodies. Hence it appears that a healthy life is depending on the subject needs and habits but also on his genetic background. Thus it might be more complex than a balaned diet. There is no doubt that in order to have a healthy life a balanced diet is needed. However what we would like to highlight here is that there is no recepe for a perfect healthy life ; it is more like a trial and error method and noone knows our body more than ourselfs. The fist step to reach an healthy life, in my opinion, is regularity. In fact the body needs to have a rythm to not be too quickly exhausted. The more the situation is known, the less it requieres energy or changes in our system. That doesn't mean that we need to be like robots but sleeping and eating at a particular schedule can be a good start. Then it is important to feed ourself with fresh food of quality even though it is more complicated to find and it is often (but not always) more expensive than the low quality products that are mainly proposed to us.I find it scray that people are able to understand the consequences of putting bad oil in there precious car but don't realize what they are asking to their body when feeding it with rubbish. It is necessary that our leaders and specially the responsables of the public health take their responsabilities and comdamn firms that are producing and selling unhealthy products. Also a healthy life is a huge challenge and we should help our kids as soon as possible in understanding their needs and explaining them how mechanic and chimic is their body, and even in that ideal situation a healthy life is still a day-to-day fight.

"Obviously, it may be true to say that social networks is a great way to discuss with people all around the world in a few seconds. However, a lot of people tend to think that we are becoming more isolated. What is the right answer? For my part, I'm clearly convinced it's an amazing way to bring people closer together. Moreover, you can catch up people you don't see anymore. To be more precise I met a friend I hadn't seen for almost 15 years thanks to Facebook! Besides, during the exam period, most students help each other on socials networks. By this, I mean they share summaries, try to resolve previous exams together. Even during the year they create groups on Facebook where they can communicate easily about they lessons, or other activities. Nevertheless, to some extent, teenagers tend to stay behind their computer instead of going out with their friends. Moreover, they feel self-confident and use to say a lot of things they wouldn't say in real life. Clearly, I do believe social networks is maybe the most usedul technology of our generation. It can help people in a lot of ways. However, we have to be careful, this cutting-edge technology has some limits, especially with children. Remember you it does not replace real relationships that people can build up together ! ",C1,0364.xml

And then obviously there's a main story, with ""good"" characters and villains. But the most important in this masterchief is the evolution, indeed, it's awesome because we can see how the characters and the situation of the city evolved. Sometimes it was pretty stunning because we weren't waiting for that, but other times we were right about the guessing and we happy because we see us as a seer. Finally, it's also great because we can discover new technologies and new habits of the people, for example they don't eat breakfast anymore. ",B1,0199.xml
"I think that studying abroad is a fantastic opportunity who can help people to find theirselves and learn to love their lifes. Meeting other cultures and people may open the eyes about love, friendship, family and also permit a relativisation of the ""everyday problems"". Some people need to get away of their little bubble and discover the world and what are their possibilities. It's always a good idea to change our point of view too and see what's really going on in other countries. You can grow, you can change, you can feel more secure and more confident when you came back. For me, studying abroad is actually the study of life. Even if you go there to study a language of to learn in an university. They are now so much people travelling that you will meet people from the entire world, from China to Canada. This is a really good path to follow but in the other hand it's not a good idea to force people to go studying abroad. They are some people who need their entourage, their friends and family to grow and leaving everyone may be too difficult. I think that this must stay an opportunity that you can take of refuse. We have to respect the decision of everyone and nothing's better than to feel that you can make everything you want with your life. ",B2,0628.xml
"Last night i went to an event called ""Spring Tech Edition"" organised by the Kot &amp; Mix which rassembled many techno Dj's. The price was as low as 3 euros even though they had booked some pretty famous artists. Let me tell you, the music was so great that i found it hard to even go out for a minute to get some fresh air. The sound quality was flawless, there were great visuals, the place was nice and overall, everything was well organised. Unfortunately, there was not as many people as the Kot &amp; Mix crew predicted, my guess is that the bad weather was a turn off for some of them. Nonetheless i'm sure everyone, from the dj's to the people dancing had a great time there. I do hope that the Kot &amp; Mix crew planned to throw more parties like this one because it's a great step back from the mainstream scene and a way to enjoy lesser known artist's music.

"As price of goods is important in people's choice in consuming, instead of taxing on added value created, taxing on generated pollution would help people in consuming goods, products which are the less worst. Another idea is to tax imported goods produced in countries where environment standards are not as difficult to achieve as our. The objective is to play on the same playing field and give a chance to everyone to be competitive. This should concern not only environment matters but also respect of working conditions.

The main character demonstrate a personnality below every human in the start, but after reached some encounter he growed in a manner than no one could have expected and it's the main reason why it's truly enjoyable. The peronnality of the main character is not enough to judge a book, in fact we don't judge a book by his cover,  the writing is well made by the author thus the reading is fluid and fast. The content is well made too, there is no ""weird"" part in the story that make the reader think ""what the fuck ?!"" or ""But..., it's not what he has talk about before..."". The dialogues between the characters is, sometimes serious and sometimes hilarious, and that make the reader in a very good mood because of these changes.

Due to this reflexion, I would give a part of this fortune to poor countries, poor families and children; people who will need this money much more than me. Also, I would propably ground a foundation who cares about women and their children who has to run away from war or violent husband or father all around the world.

Another key factor is the huge financial potential of these networks given that they provide advertising place for companies. In addition,the way we develop our relationships radically changed because today's people focus on superficial relations.

"Nowadays, there is an increasing number of people using social networks like Facebook or Twitter to communicate with others. A lot of researches have been done to identify the impact these site can have on relationships. Indeed, social medias can bring people together but they can also tear them apart. Firstly, social medias give people the opportunity to find and stay in touch with old friends. Indeed, almost everyone has already done some researches to contact people they have not seen for many years. However, social medias don't always have a positive impact on the relationships. In fact, some people prefer to talk with friends via social medias instead of meeting them in real life. This can affect their friendship in the long term because their relationship would turn superficial. Moreover, people using only social media to communicate with others will tend to fall in depression. To conclude, social medias are good opportunities to stay in touch with friends but it is also important to meet people in real life. ",C1,0403.xml

"By definition, a social network is ""a network of social interactions and personal relationships"". At first, it sure was an innovative way to facilitate communication and help people keep in touch with friends and family that live on the other side of the world. It was a great idea, however, somehow social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others seem to have had an unwanted effect on our relationships. Nowadays, young people are hooked on their smart phones or computers all day, sharing their lives on the internet behind heir screens instead of sharing it with other people and having real life experiences. Everything goes through texts or pictures and nothing is authentic anymore. Interactions with others have become awkward to the point that people don't even look at each other when they walk by in the street.

"It is true that having a balanced diet is really important in order to have a healthy life but i would not say that it is the most important one. In my opinion, people who want to pay attention to their health should not only be concerned about their food but also their whole lifestyle. For instance, being active and practice sport every day is as important as eating well. We can also add the time of sleep or the amount of stress in the person's life as major factors. Moreover it should not be forgotten that having a healthy life has a cost, it is not possible for everybody to buy fresh products on a daily basis when our supermarkets are filled with cheap processed food. In addition of this, someone who has a really busy life, a full time job and/or a family do not always have time to prepare a healthy meal and will prefer to order some pizza's.

Otherwise they will be burned and that's going to spread out a very toxic smoke which is hardocre for the environment.

"Many factors are thought to influence our health, eating a balanced diet, doing enough sports, sleeping enough, going outside, ... But is one of those really more important than the others ?

Nowadays, we tend to exagerate the proportions, we eat to much to sugary, to greasy, to salty, ... Our society influences us to eat many things that are not good for us. Obesity is one of the worse consequences of this trend and there are no other solution than eating healthily to avoid this. However, eating healthy is not enough an one needs to exercice and sleep enoug to be in good shape. Doing no exercice is indeedvery harmfull for the body as it loses all its muscles.

"The influence of social networks on relationships is almost an alleged fact. If we look at the current behaviour of people, it is obvious that social networks play a huge role in our lives. Most of the time people having a smartphone are not able to quit it. Everyone ""must"" always check if there is some news on Twitter or Facebook. We lead our lives under the impression that social networks are a must. Being on it becomes mandatory. Being out of it becomes weird. In this way, social networks become paradoxical. On one hand, they try to get people closer and on the other hand they put some distance between them. Of course we must admit that people are given the opportunity to keep in touch with friends living abroad thanks to social networks. But if we go deeper, we understand that people are never where they should be. People are not living hic et nunc but far away from here and at an other period of time. Another paradoxical aspect of the social networks is that it gives the impression to offer people more freedom but in fact, it is the contrary. People act as they were slaves, slaves of their profile, of their page. In conclusion I would express my opinion like this : social networks change our lives but not always in a good way. Even if it has the appearance to be a progres, I think it is not. ",C1,0372.xml

This book have really stopped my mind, first because of the writting is really matching with my thinking way, and second because the story is really about hard emotions and incomprehension, and deep passion for dance. The character is a really interested psychological person. At the end of that book she have to stop dancing because she stopped eatting to be on the body norms, but she broke her leg because of that weakness to do not eat. This story will always stay in my mind. And I was a teenager when i read this for the first time. So, that gave it even more sense. ",B1,0212.xml

"The Fashion Week in Paris is an extremely big event for the city. In fact, it brings together a lot of poeple from the four sides of the planet. I went to two shows, the first was Valentino and the second was Chanel. It's very impressive to go to that kind of event because you meet important poeple from the world of fashion and your behaviour has to be perfect. Everyone i for sure extremely well dressed. It's all about fashion and beauty, all about appearance actually. When you think about that, it's pretty awfull. Poeple go to that kind of show to be seen, to be admired and at the end, this has nothing more to have with fashion. Anyway it was a good experience but you have to keep in your mind that it's all very superficial and fake. ",B1,0206.xml
"The house of happiness I'm only fifty-two years old but I sometimes think about the old age. When I see old people who can't stay any more alone at home, I'm sad. I know some of them in my circle. Their children are obliged to put them in an old people's home. They would prefer to stay with their family and friends. If I won one million euros, here's what I would do: I would buy a piece of land and I would build a comfortable house with some flats. Every flat would contain a bedroom, a bathroom and a sitting room. In this building, there would be also rooms for the community life as a kitchen, a living-room, a sitting-room with a television, a terrace and a garden. Many people like a cook, a nurse, a gardener and others would be in charge of the elderly people and would live among them with their family. So these people would never be alone and would live happy. One day, when I'll be old, I would seize the opportunity to live like them in my house of happiness. ",B1,0548.xml

"Some people argue that social networks these days are not social at all. They would say that people juste talk online and don't have time or interest in seeing each other aymore, all because of the popularity of social networks. Although I agree that in some case people get lazy and just stay at home, I sincerely think that social networks are not the only reason to that. I would on the contrary say that they have loads of positive aspects that people don't always take into account. The most obvious advantage of social networks is, of course, the fact that you can stay in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore, or friends that live far away from you. I'm aware that everyone know about this  aspect, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't take it into account. It remains one of the main selling points of socal networks. The second aspect that I want to share, is the fact that social networks can be very usefull for school projects, or even just ""the student life"". I'm concentrating here on Facebook, because it is the one that I use most. During my study years, I've found Facebook to be a great plateform to share knowledge. I'm of course refering to course notes that can be shared with an entire auditorium in a matter of seconds. For example, students create groups for each class that they have. After each course some people decide to share their notes with everyone, help each other out and therefore have better notes for the whole group! An other interesting use of facebook can be groups for group projects. You create your group on facebook with your group mates in real life and that makes the whole ""organization of the work"" a lot easier, every information can be stored online and reachable for every member of the group. My third and last point is  that social networks make the planning of an event really simple, whether it be a party with your firends, a music festival or something more official, like a speach or a reunion. You just have to create an ""event"", invite people to it and from know on advertise, wait for people to click on ""going"", and tell about it to their friends and so on. A piece of cake! In conclusion I would say that, of course there are some downsides to social networks, but what doesn't have some in this life? In my opinion, social networks, make contacts and planning a lot easier than before. They allow everyone, from simple people to organizations of huge event, to reach a large audience really easilly.

"Obviously, it may be true to say that social networks is a great way to discuss with people all around the world in a few seconds. However, a lot of people tend to think that we are becoming more isolated. What is the right answer? For my part, I'm clearly convinced it's an amazing way to bring people closer together. Moreover, you can catch up people you don't see anymore. To be more precise I met a friend I hadn't seen for almost 15 years thanks to Facebook! Besides, during the exam period, most students help each other on socials networks. By this, I mean they share summaries, try to resolve previous exams together. Even during the year they create groups on Facebook where they can communicate easily about they lessons, or other activities. Nevertheless, to some extent, teenagers tend to stay behind their computer instead of going out with their friends. Moreover, they feel self-confident and use to say a lot of things they wouldn't say in real life. Clearly, I do believe social networks is maybe the most usedul technology of our generation. It can help people in a lot of ways. However, we have to be careful, this cutting-edge technology has some limits, especially with children. Remember you it does not replace real relationships that people can build up together ! ",C1,0404.xml
"In my point of view, it 's very more important to have an enjoyable job, a job which you feel beter with. Every morning, when you wake-up, you know that you will be usefull .

"The study abroad is first of all a choice In my opinion, study abroad should remain a choice. Admittedly, studying in a foreigner country is potentially very beneficial because this kind of study puts the person in good predisposition in order to imporve their skill in another language or to become more able to handle various situations. However, making it compulsory would create several problems : some people can't afford to be ""expatriated"" or just don't want to. This could be caused by financial, familial issues or they don't have the right temperament to handle such a journey. Taking this in consideration, study abroad should be more encouraged but still be a way that a student could have the choice to take or not. ",B2,0349.xml
"I think study abroad don't must a compulsory but be seen like a opportunity to improve a language study, meet other cultures or do a intership. - Sometimes, after one year abroad like a second retho, it's difficult to study seriously with success. Again : - All families don't have enough money to send their teens abroad. - The diploma's are not always valid in our own country. - The teens' parents can have a lack of trust in the welcome and the security of their children. - The youngs must be enough concern to not confound studies and holidays. - with internet, children will follow international cursus at home. It will be more safe, economic mostly for parents. For: - Abroad, the teens become faster independant. They learn to face alone problems, sickess, good or bad mood ... - It is the best opportunity to learn a other language in a little time. - It's appreciate when you apply for a job in Belgium. - It you are looking forward to live in an other country; it a good opportunity to check if it like you though. - ",B2,0605.xml

For example there is not enough places in my train on the morning, so I have to take my own car to go to work, so do all my colleagues...

"In my opinion, to be happy in your job is really more important than to make money. Indeed, money alone doesn't make you happy. Money is of course also important in order to have a good balance in the life and in the job, but it is not enough. Beside this, studies showed that a good motivation in the job depends more on the goals or on the atmosphere with the colleagues and the hierarchy than on the salary. As a matter of fact, salary is just a part of motivation. In case of salary's increase, you 're happy at the beginning, but this feeling of happyness because of the augmentation won't stay after a few weeks or months, you will be used to this. ",B2,0638.xml

"From my point of view and my personnal experience, study abroad should be a compulsory part of education. I went abroad around 18 years old, during 1 month in the USA to improve my english and it was such a great experience: I improved my english, i discovered a new country/culture and i met new peoples from all around the world. Moreover I went there by my self so it's aso a great personnal challenge. Then 2 years later, I made an internship in London for 4 months, amazing experience too. And finally I did an Erasmus semester in London. Thoses 6 months in London were amazing: I was living a dream by living in my favourite city, always doing something et discovering new things everyday and meeting people. Those 3 experiences abroad were my choice, never in highschool/upgrade studies they suggest us to go abroad. But as french, the english courses in collegre, high school are not pushed and I really imporved my english by going abroad. So I think that the school need to propose a time abroad (from 2 weeks to severals months) to let students have this opportunity. Of course we need to care in consideration also the financial part...find a way that help also the one who have less revenue to have this experience, to enjoy it.

"While most people in this society believe it is beter to make money, I would argue that it is more important to have an inspiring job. It is generally accepted that a person works almost 30 years in his life. In other words, his job takes the major part of his time. It is therefore important to like what he are doing. Otherwise, he is more subject to depression. It is not a coincidence that the major problem of today is the burnout. However, it is probably true to say that making money could keep people happy. By this I mean that money can contribute to an adequate living standard. Taking everything into consideration, it is important to have a compromise between an enjoyable job and a job that pays enough to live corretly. ",B2,0348.xml
"It is probably true to say that the internet, particularly social networks, has a huge impact on society. Indeed, social networks allow to people to meet new people around the world.

For instance, Facebook bring people close together and population can extend their relations. However, there is a real tendancy to believe that teenagers spend more and more time behind their smartphones and chat with their friends. Consequently, I think that social networks can damage relationships between members of society. Real life is not to remain behind a screen and chatting with people but really see friends and spending time with them. To sum up, I really tend to think that social networks has a impact on relationships. I agree that social networks allows to people to keep contact with people who are living abroad but we should stop remain behind our screen and benefit of the life by spending time  with our close friends and relations.

Moreover, I would buy 2 or 3 cars (not specially luxuous) to be independant and  a swimming pool to enjoy the summer holidays. Finally I would go the casino for the first time of my life to have a great time with my friends but I would stop before losing all my money. ",B1,0214.xml

"in my opinion study abroad should be a part of education. it would bring a lot of advantages. First to study in another language. it is surely the best way of learning a language without no other option that using the four competencies of learning. Secondly to meet people from other culture, other habit, and to understand that our way of leaving is certainly common but not necessary the most appropriate and can be challenged. Finaly because of leaving, studying or working abroad obliges you to go out your day to day life and certainly to be challenged by the new situations you'll face with. It is the best way and probably the most quick way to grew up and to reach a good self confidence. ",B2,0594.xml
"the best book I've ever read is called ""la formle de Dieu"" written by jozé rodriguez dos santos. the purpose of this book is to show, by the way of physics and quantum mechanic, that the whole universe would have been created by an intelligent being. What attracted me a lot is the fact that the whole scientific content is empiricaly founded or defended by number of scientist. So it me makes my reading more interesting due to all implication about the human life that are revealed in this book. But it's also because of the author who makes understandable something witch is occult for a lot of poeple : the quantum mechanic. furthermore it is romanced, so there is more tan the scientific content that makes me keep reading whitout thinking that it was to heavy for me.

So i think that i will buy a lot of sure actions in Wall street and make sure that they don't increase... Next step, i must engage an accountant to be sure that i won't spend my money in one day. So i would entoure myself with professionals, and make my fortune grown. and after that when i will be sure that i don't have to work for the rest of my life, i would give a lot of money to my parents and my brothers (before i must be perfectly sure that that they will do a good use of this money too). i would give a lot of money to a lot to charity.

"Social networks have become a huge part in people's lives and are widespread. For example, one seventh of the population on earth is on Facebook only. People carry their social networks accounts in their pockets which enable them to access them at any time. Therefore, they have an impact on their users. This impact can be invisible. Indeed, users aren't always aware of it. They don't see that they slowly develop their virtual life : adding friends, photos, informations about themselves. Then, they have to edit those informations, post more photos, share more. Instead of sharing their experiences with their friends next time they gather, they do it instantly. That is one of the plus side of social networks, everythings goes faster : we can reach our firends, talk to them one by one or ten by ten even, we can organise events, share articles, news, videos ...  Knowledge about you, your friends and familiy goes faster. You can also keep in touch with people physically far away from you. Social networks vanish the limits that distance had etablished.Unfortunatly, this can lead to people only developping their virtual life and neglecting their real life. Social networks can have much bigger impacts. People can become famous by spreding their talents through them but others can also use them to harm people they now in real life on a more public place.

Of course I will still study at the university and I could afford the best helps that exists to succeed, because now I'm actually not so rich and I don't wanna ask my parents to lend me money, I'm not comfortable with it. I won't give money to some charity because we can never truly know what the money is really used at.

"I think it's more important to have an enjoyable job. To make money is also important but it's not a way to happiness. I prefer to be happy by enojoying my job. Every morning, I wake up and, if I like my job, I'll be happy. If I work only to make money and to have more and more money, the wake up will be difficult and the life become without sense. But being too poor is not a solution. Sometimes we see some artists who don't have any money and become homeless. I don't want to become like that. I think everyone have to find the right mesure between earning money and having a fun or enjoyable job. Job isn't all the time fun. People talk about 'bore out' phenomenon. I don't agree with that. A job doesn't have to be interesting. The first fonction is to earn money. If I like my job, it's better but it's not an obligation. ",B2,0609.xml

"I think it is really more important to have a job that we like because we spend a lot of time to work. This long time we have to be concentrated and effective with what we do. That for, we have to be motivated. And how could we be motivated if we don't like our job? Nevertheless, money is important also because if we don't have enought money we will have a lot of problems to eat, to pay our bills and loans, and so on. I also think that a job that make money does'nt always give a good quality of life. If it is a very stresful job with a lo of responsibilities, we will come back home stressed and tired and our job will affect our private life. With that kind of situation, we can have as money as we want, we won't be happy with our job. That can lead to a lack of motivation that breeds to a diminution of productivity and even to problem with the boss. It is why we say ""money does'nt buy happiness"" and why I think that it is more important to have an enjoyable job than to make money. ",B2,0635.xml
"Absolutely. Discovering other cultures and foreign languages should be inherent to education. We live in a global world but it's only virtual. Newspapers, television, internet carry many stereotypes and lies. The best way to learn respect is to experiment real human connections. The big problem here in west Europe, America and all ""developped"" countries is that we are living in a virtual version of reality. I mean our clothes, food, technologies are most of time produced in countries with bad conditions of life. We have to reappropriate our consciences. We have to reappropriate our Earth.

"The ideal situation would be to have a nice job and to earn enough money too, but in day to day life it is extremely difficult to have both of them. So if I had to choose it would be really hard for me because we live in the consumerism era. However I like more situations when I do activities that I enjoy than making money. I never think about money while I'm working, but about objectives, about ways of improving myself in that job even if I won't be rewarded at the end. There is no difference for me of involvement in an activity if it's paid or unpaid.

"It is probably true to say that you could have a more comfortable life if you make more money. People argue that if you have a higher loan, you can plan more travels, have more activities. However, I am not sure that having more money balances the fact that you have a job you don't like. Indeed, a survey demonstrates that people who enjoy their job are happier than workers who make a lot of money but who don't like what they do. If you go deeper through this reflection, you can easily conclude that you can have a confortable life if each time you come back from work you are bored and not in great shape. To conclude, I do thing that it is more important to enjoy your daily life and so to be happy everyday because you can't buy happinness and so to have the money to make great things will only provide you some happy moments against the daily times you will have with a nice work. Now it's up to you to choose what kind of life you want to. ",B2,0350.xml

It's written by a pastor who works as a kind of psychologist (he listens to people who have difficulties or who are in emotional distress). By listening to many different people he learned a lot about ""love"" and the different kinds of how people express their love to others. That's how he discovered the five languages of love: ""the physical touching/tenderness"", ""moments of quality"", ""serviability"", ""presents"" and ""praising by words"". In the book he describes theese different languages by giving some theoretical aspects and also some personal statements of people that he met during the years. ",B1,0224.xml

If a thing from your past has stopped your positive evolution you must work this thing out to leave this negative atmosphere.

"In my opinion, study abroad is very important for the education. Nowadays, it's expensive to study abroad so if it's compulsory, maybe the governement would make it more affordable. Plus, in school we have only five hours of'English lessons which is not enough! At least you're immersed, it's impossible to get ou of school bilingual. Study abroad would make the young more independant, they would learn and see another culture and they would considerably improve their second language. Furthermore, more and more young people are lazy or too confortable in their routine to go study abroad by themselve but I think it's an experience which would do them good. In conclusion, study abroad should be a compulsory part of education, even if it's for a few days because the young could see something else and maybe it would make them study and learn better.

It certainly depends of the age of the students... to my own experience i think it's clear that travelling abroad and meet native foreign langage's speakers is really positive ! it force you to speak and learn not to fear to make mistakes. but fisrt of all you already need a good basic knowledge of the langage you want to practice abroad... it  will allow you to progress rapidly and to be more selfconfident in front of the others. But this is only theorical because not everyone wants to go abroad and most of the parents neither so i think it should not be compulsory during school but more offered as a possiblitity to those who really want to do it. This possibility already exist with exchange programs as Erasmus or private programs as Best or Rotary and it really works for thoses who can take part of it. Europe should increase the budget allowed to those programs and so increase the amount of people who could share this wonderfull life experience but still even if all students went to study abraod for some time.. the most important is to continue to practice once they get back home ! So the education on school and at home still stay the most powerfull help to learn ! to resume i should say that it should not be compulsory but really offered (also financially) to those who wants to try it ! ,B2,0583.xml

"I think it is more important to have a job that you love. An enjoyable job that make you happy and contented. If you're feeling good in your mind and soul, you won't need to have lots of money. The necessary will be enough. You won't need to go on holidays to far away and sunny places, or to go to the spa or the restaurant often because your everyday world and life will fulfill these needs of well-being and wellness. Furthermore, a person that enjoys its job is going to do it better that someone that doesn't enjoy it. I think that getting money for a job that makes you feel unfulfilled is some kind of dangerous for your health. Cases of burn-out and depression doesn't come from nowhere, and they're highly bonded with a feeling of overwork and mental fatigue. These come when a person do a job that she doesn't enjoy, even if she gets lots of money for it. Going on holiday won't resolve the problem, it could even getting it worse. So I think that everyone should choose a job that he loves, regarding to the heart and not the wallet. Cause it's our heart that makes us live. ",B2,0346.xml

Before that, I had already read some passages of it at school, and I found them funny. But what I really appreciate in this book, it is that everybody can read it at all ages. The comprehension of the story is different when you grow up, because you can understand more things, and the moral lessons that are in. So, years after I received it, I still love it, and I can read it again and again. It always learns me something about life, makes me think about my trajectoire of life, and makes me happy.

"Unfortunately, I feel like campuses aren't places for open minds anymore. In many unversities, professors share their knowledge with students without any way to encourage them to analyze, the topics they teach, with a critical approach. Indeed, campuses seemed to be places where people can exchange their opinions and reach a higher comprehension level of what surround them and see different point of views of society issues for example. Despite of a real multiculturalism in universities, lectures don't allow a relevant debate on our society. ",B1,0192.xml
"I definitly think that eating a balanced diet is important to have a healthy life. Nevertheless there is no beter factor, it is a mix of different things. Firstly having a balanced diet gives to your body all the nutrients it need. There is therefore less chances to have a deficiency in nutrients and it prevents from disease. Your body needs those nutrients to enable it to defend himself against virus. It is not because you eat healty food that you eat food you don't like. You can combine healty food and good food. Secondly i thing that regularly exercice strenghtens not only our body but also our mind. It give us the opportunity to set objectives and reach them. It learn determination and not giving up when you come into the first difficulty. Determination is a skill you have to develop if you want to have a good career. You don't become the big boss easily, you have to work hard to reach your goals. Finaly you should allow yourself some cheat meals such as french fries, crisps and meat with sauce at least once a week. This threat should be during the week-end. It is a kind of reward. As a conclusion i would say that a balance diet should go with exercices and cheat meals to allow you a few pleasure during the week. ",C1,0384.xml
"The matter is actually quite hard to awnser to. With a bit of background some say that it's possble, others don't, but the matter of fact is that it ain't easy. I think the main problem stands by the definition of what our modern societies consider the public space and the private space. By those definitions we can already make a link between public space and media. Therefore, the media is not only the key but also the main factor that allows the knowledge and the spred of information. The private space is, by the social status of the person (actor, celebrity, etc) confused and by that, I mean that there is a fusion of those two spaces. There is also another factor that is important to take into consideration. The social status of a person, doesn't have to define the person in question. The private life doesn't have to be the part of that person regardeless of his social status that is used for media propaganda. I think that the Ethical and deonthological code of joursalists and papparazzis sould be renewed and take into consideration more and severe penalities if their code is not respected. A person should be respected no matter it's social status, no matter what that person is acused of or what rumors tell about her. That is the main reason why the integrity of a person should be respected. It's beacuse of his right to privacy. ",C1,0390.xml

"I don't think it should be compulsory because some students may not enjoy going abroad. We cannot impose such a thing to someone. But I think that the opportunity should be offered to everyone. Maybe at the last year of high school, we could propose to students to go 6 months abroad to finish their cursus. Or schools could also work with organisation such as WEP to encourage students to go abroad. We should also give scholarship to every students who desire to go abroad because it is very expensive and not everyone can have a scholarship nowadays so by giving them more easily, more students would go abroad. Belgian schools should develop a kind of network with other schools in other countries, so the exchange would be easier. Studying abroad have a lot of advantages, it is a real asset in a life. We definitely should invest in that perspective. ",B2,0596.xml

On the orther hand, earning a good salary is always nice and can give you more motivation...but not for a long time if you don't like enough your job.

First of all welcome to my readers. What would i do with one million euros? You don't have lots of solution to this question. You can invest it and then create more money with it or just spend it in every things you ever would. I think i would make a mix of them. One part i would invest into business changes and  buildings. With the other part i wish spend it in computer's pieces in order to upgrade it very well. I wouldn't spit on a beautiful car aswell. Spending time in a ski holiday with friends would also be a very good idea. I would save the left over up in bank because we never know what the life is made of and we all need money every time.

"This Saturday, I've attended to the 20th Durbuy Rock Festival in the lovely village of Bomal sur Ourthe (Belgium). This festival is dedicated to rock and metal music such as death metal, folk metal, black metal, ... and many others ! Despite of the fact that this event is more concerned by extreme metal, what I've found interesting is that there was many bands of other types, and so everybody could be happy ! This festival takes a week-end, from friday evening to sunday morning. Personnaly, I've decided to reach the festival for the Saturday. In my opinion, it has a great level for the price asked (40 euros per day, 60 euros for 2 days and the camping). Prices of beer and food are really democratic too for an event of this type. The camping seems to be clean and respectuous of the environment. Too, there's canoe-kayak balads in front of the site. Finally, I have to say that, for a little festival like that, I've found that there was a great ambiance and a nice feeling of fraternity and family ! Many parents came with their childrens and old people where there too. ",B1,0237.xml

"The use of the social networks can isolate people but it can also bring people closer together. Firstly, the social networks can put people from different countries in touch. In my view, the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, ... have facilitated the communication between people. For example, with Facebook, it is easier to organise meetings or events for a project. However, there are a lot of problems with these social networks : people can become more aggressive with others than in real life. They think that they are more protected behind their computers. Secondly, the use of the social networks is now easier to meet new people and socialize than the mobile phone or others technologies. Clearly, the Internet is less expensive and is quicker than these other technologies. Moreover, in real life, people are a litle bit more shy than behind their screens and, so, it is easier for them to admit feelings and to say private things. Finally, I tend to think that people can become more isolated by using the social networks if they stay all their days and all their nights on their computer. To sum up, I believe that the social networks have bought people close together. ",C1,0357.xml

"Good question. The best will be to have both, an enjoyable job and a correct money revenue. We can say that the old habits, our parents and all the old system always put money like a carrot above a donkey. But time is changing. The new generations seems to be more mature to quickly  understand that life can be short, that nothing is really secure, and they work more in a place that correspond to their first motivation. Money is important but comes after the reason of the day job. And I think that it's a good idea. Even, a way to make good results. When you are running all days only for making money, you never make great innovations like when you have the fire to make goals. When all your mind goes straight to the point, for the result, for your motivation, to make an enjoyable job because you give it a sense to it, often the success isn't really far, and the money neither.

I explain my idea : at every moment while at home, at work or every where else, if you are going to do something, try to quickly mentally guess if your action is environmentally the best one to do like : ""Is it better for our nature that I keep the tap of the sink open while I am using the soap or that I close the water?""

It's a book that I have read in holiday on the beach.  This kind of story is good for student, in general girls love that. Despite, you can't study new knowledge but it's just for plaiser.

"No, I do not think so because going abroad to study foreign language should be, and mainly for young people, a free decision only due to your own motivation and wish. If you make it mandatory, it should be for everyone and so, it will be very difficult to organize and to implement even for people not learning or interested by an other language than French. A mandatory period in a foreign country , that I suppose to be at least a few weeks or months to be efficient, could be also a psychological problem for some familly. I recognize that studying a foreign language abroad is the best way to learn it but it should be proposed only to motivated and interested students. It should be also done for other kind of study (manual, technical or others) with the possibility to learn directly in a related professional environment as an industry, an hospital ...with the same goal : implementing what you are learning in real and professional conditions.

"If I had one million euros, I'll probably use it for something I care about. My first idea is to give all the money to chirldren from Africa who really need that. I think it can help them to have for example some threatments to cure them, or it can give them the  possibilty of building a school so they can have the education they deserve, as everyone does. If the money I have can make other people happier, that will be the best I can hope. ",B1,0142.xml
"I think that the most important thing in life is to do the things you like. Therefore, I believe that having an enjoyable job is more important than making money. You'll certainly keep your job your entire life, so you have to choose it carefully, and you'd better choose something that will make you happy. Otherwise you will be really unhappy and you won't take any pleasure in doing your job. Of course, if you can find a job that you like and that is well-paid, it's even better because, let's be honest, money helps being happy. ",B2,0630.xml
"I don't think so. In my opinion, study abroad should be a choice and not an obligation. It can be to much expensive for some parents to pay the travel. Of course, study abroad is a really good choice to learn a new language. However, if the goal is really to learn a new language, I think it can be succesful by an immersion for kids : there is no more efficient method to learn a language by an immersion in an english class, for instance. It's really easy for kids to learn a language because their brain is evolving. In conclusion, I think that study abroad should not be a compulsory part of education. However, the immersion in a class to learn a new language is, for kids, a solution that should be more implemented. ",B2,0618.xml
"In my opinion, having an enjoyable job is really more important than making money in a human being life. On the one hand, doing things we like during job hours allows us to feel fulfilled because what we do will have more sense, and finding sense in life for a human being is the ultimate quest. On the other hand, be focused on making money in our job does not necessarily make someone happy, because being in this perspective brings a lot of stress, a lot of competition and a the end a lot of selfishness, things that are in my opinion incompatible with a happy life.

"In my opinion, learning abroad helps a lot to study a language, and open the mind. But it's not so easy for everybody. And it's not compulsory to go far away. In Belgium we should learn a few months in Flanders for a French speaker, and learn in Wallonie for a Dutch speaker for example. I know some people that have done it and they told me it was an extra experience! I'm sure, if I should go for a month in America, when I come back I will have improved a lot my English speaking!

"It's complicated to improve the environment without paying a huge amount of money. So I would first change all the things that are easy to improve.

I would also put more trashes in the city so that the inhabitants can easilly throw their waste in it. Indeed, in many countries their are not enough thrashes so everybody throws their plastics, bottles... on the ground. The cities would be cleaner. There are all little things which everybody can do to improve the environment. If everyone do something to help the planet, it would make plenty of things simple. ",B2,0625.xml

"For century, we have been caliming our right to privacy. What conclusions must be drawns when it comes to people who live in the public eyes On the one hand, in respect of human rights, everybody has a right to privacy as it has been stated in many legal texts. This include of course the right of privacy even for those people. On the other hand, in order to meet the requirements of their responsabilties, public personnailities have to provide as much transparency as possible to prove their willingness to work for public interest. Eventually, the trade-off between these two arguments can be easily observed. Hence, everytime we come across a situation where privacy in public functions is questioned, in each one of these requirements must be balanced by the other one. Eventually, a line must be drawn between their private life where privacy is the queen and public offices where their is this trade-off. ",C1,0369.xml
"Nowadays, the internet is more and more used to socialize. We may admit that the internet is a tool that allows people to communicate easily, but some people have a different point of view. Following their ideas, the internet may isolate users. Let we compare the pros and cons of such technology. On the one hand, it is easily to communicate quickly with someone that we cannot see directly and we have the opportunity to speak with a lot of people at the same time. Moreover, internet gives us the chance to meet people who are far from us. So, we can avoid long travels by using skype (video-conference) of other technologies for example. On the other hand, it breakdown face-to-face communications. By using internet, we are in front of a screen and not in front of a real person. We are isolated from real life. In my opinion, we cannot have a real personal conversation if we are far from the other person. The talk is generally only superficial. However, there are a lot of situations where we cannot speak directly (in the same room). To sum up, it is better to avoid using the internet to communicate when we have the opportunity to meet other people in real-life. However, it is a useful tool when a direct conversation is impossible. ",C1,0382.xml

We could all make an effort to use renewable energy as often as we can, and to do so, it would be important to teach people how to create such energy, how to use it and how it would help improve the environment for everyone including them. Everyone should be concerned with this problem. The major problem is to change mentality. It is a problem on every level of society, every changes seem to be a big obstacle to go throught whereas sometimes organization is the only thing to settle.

"Studying Business Ingeneering, I will be on the Job market in two years and therefore I am asking my self about what kind of job I will look for : An enjoyable one or would I prefer a bigger wage? Of course the best option would be both making money and having an simpathetic job. I truly think that those kinds of jobs exist. There are maybe hard to find but life is long enought to find it. Yet ending university I will have to find a job quickly and therefore it will be hard to directly find my dream job. I think that a that moment I will choose the job that will makes my learned what I like most. At that time the most important thing will be the atmosphere, how I am feeling. Then after having learned new things, after having grew my network, I will have enought knowledge to find and to get the job that feet best to me. There the salary will have a way bigger impact on my choice because I want to enjoy life without having ""money-fences"". To conclude both salary and the job feeling are important for me.

"""Money doesn't make you happy"". That's what they say. When you look at my life, you could think I don't care about money. I'm doing History at Uni and everyone is telling me that I will have no money later if I don't find a rich husband. Ok, that's a bit caricatural and it's wrong saying it like that. But, I know I will earn less money with my historian graduate than with a scientist graduate. I can't tell you which one is the best between a job that you love or a job to makemoney. I think, the best thing to do is to choose a job that you want to do and that provides you enough money to survive. But don't choose a job you dislike. I know that when you're very poor, you are all the time thinking ""can I buy that?"" ""Can I go to this expensive country?"". So, I don't want that because it can even impact you relationship with your friends, husband, family.  Worring has never been a good thing. I don't want to have debt neither. So I choose a job that still give me some money but that I enjoy to do. For example, selling books. I love books, I love talking about books I read and discover new ones. So it's not my dreaming job but it's something I would enjoy to do and that can provide me money. When I was young, thinking my parents would all the time being behind me, I tought I could be a painter or writting comics. But then, school, society tell you you can't because you need to be the best one to live doing this kind of job. But I still love art. I realised that it doesn't need to be my job. I can read, drawing, playing music or theater in my free time. So, I will try to find a job that I enjoy to do even if it's not a passion and doing activities that I really love in my free times.

Secondly, the direct participation of citizens must be encouraged. Because, the population is not yet aware of the climate change's effects.

"Environment is a critical concern for the future of mankind. An important part of our economy and sustain depends on the environment (forestry, fishery, agriculture, medicine ...) and it is our duty to protect it. We should, for example, consider more seriously the use of biological control as a good mean to reduce the populations of harmful insects in the crops. It won't only lead to the decrease of pest population but will avoid soil contamination by utilization of hazardous pesticides. Furthermore, it is essential to explain why it is important to protect the environment. The parents and teachers should work on it with the children. Education is a fundamental key. Moreover, the recycling process allows the reuse of items as raw material for the production of new items in order to save natural ressources.

It must be very  stressful to always hide yourself and see pictures of your private life in magasins made for stupid people that finance this junk business. If a politician is disturbed after somebody revealed a part of his private life he will be less efficient in his function because he will always have to justify himslef to the press.... according to me it there is more and more junk information that we don't need to know instead of telling us the truth about real matters.

"Most people agree to say that studying abroad plays a important role in students' education. As far as I am concerned, I quite agree with that point of view. I think that students living in another country far from their family during one year or more helps them to become independant and much more mature. Indeed, they learn to face difficulties and handle it alone. It is for me the best way to become a responsible adult. In my opinion, studying abroad is also a chance to discover new cultures and new ways of living. It allows people to open their minds and to learn a lot about the world. In conclusion, studying abroad is a good way to understand the society. ",B2,0284.xml
"Definitely not, I should always be a personal choice. Whether you've not enough money or just no envy, it's not a good idea to go in a foreign country. However, nobody can deny that it is a great opportunity to learn a new language and to emancipate yourself. In other words, to be more independant. Sometimes, students even decide to stay where they are, to start a 'new life'. So to resume, I would say it is a very good idea if you're hesitating, but if you know you're not prepared financially, stay where you currently are. ",B2,0290.xml

"Some people think that it is very important to make a lot of money to have a comfortable life. All people have to be completly blossomed in their work. So I think that it is very important to have an enjoyable job than making money. Of course making a lot of money can be the goal of a lot of people. Some people find an enjoyable job and make also money. This situation is the perfect deal for everyone. Sinds the first years of our professional live we can accept a unenjoyable job to make money and to earn experiences. To conclude, it is important to have at least an enjoyable job but people don't want to be difficult if they start in the professional live. ",B2,0292.xml
"Yes I think that it should be a compulsory part of education. First, I think that when we discover a new country that offers a better education, it can enable us to improve our skills and then I think that it can be a good way to find a job that we're looking for. Secondly, I'd like to speak about my personal experience abroad that is a good example to show that studying abroad is a good way to learn. I had the opportunity to study abroad and it was a really good experience that I won't forget. I had to deal with another culture, another language that I wasn't used to. It really opened my mind, I also met a lot of people from all around the world. Studying abroad is a real asset because we discover some things about ourselves that we wouldn't have discovered if we had stayed in our country. In fact, I learn how to be more independent, self-confident and that the world has to offer us a lot of great opportunities of work. To conclude, I think that now and especially because of the globalization, it's important to develop our talent abroad. The world and particularly universities of the world can offer us a good opportunity to learn differently than our Belgian system of education. In my opinion, studying abroad can help us to have a positive impact on the economy and on the cultural diversity. ",B2,0279.xml

"I don't think studying abroad is a must do. But it can learn you to have a better knowledge about an other language. I would love to study in England, because I love speaking english and it would help me to improve my english and have a better accent. Nowadays, a lot of youngsters go abroad after their secondary education and before university to learn english or an other language. I think it's a great experience, you learn to live with other habits. But I also think the youngsters aren't there to work. I think studying abroad when you are in the higher education is a good deal : you have to work and you learn a second language. I would love to do an Erasmus abroad, and especially in  England. But I also know that for communication studies, Belgiums universities are high rated, so it would be stupid to go to an other university that has not the same level as ours and that is certainly more expensive.

"Studay abroad should be a compulsory part of education because it helps you learning new languages and new people. Furthermore, it changes your way of seeing the people around you. Every student should have the opportunity to go to another countries without having to pay anything! With different teachers, we can also see the different points of view of the education all over the world but also the different points of view of the students! You can also find jobs in another country that doesn't exist in your home country. So maybe you will find a job in your host country. And last but not least, study abroad is the best thing to know who you really are and who you want to be in the near future. ",B2,0325.xml
"The best book I've ever read is The Harry Potter Saga. I appreciated the  wizards' magic world. It made me dream. Moreover I identified myself with the characters, especially Hermione Granger who's very brilliant and smart. What was funny is that I was as old as the characters. I also liked the plot and the suspense throughout the chapters and books. It captivated me. At the end of the saga, I was so sad but fortunately there were the movies. But I thought that they were not as good as the books. ",B1,0127.xml
"I guess that depends for each one. We all have to find balance between a fun and interesting job and get enough money. And how much money that means to you or what do you find fun is very personnel and can be a lo different from the next guy. For me, it's important to have enough money to pay the rent, food, clothing, doctors and a little entertainement. As soon as I have that, I will focus on finding an interesting and challenging job. If the job is boring or making me sick, that mean it's time to start to look for a new one. Still for me, there is no point to work in a living hell just to be richier. We spend to many hours working to allow it to be a nightmare ",B2,0641.xml

Don't throw junk or thinks like that in the environment, because some of them take a very long time to disapear. Besides it's very awfull to see junks everywhere in the street. One other thing would be to protect the Nature, don't use a sheet of paper to write only 2 words! You can use that sheet for one other thing. Don't kill the trees.

"I don't agree with this assertion. Even if abroad studies could improve your level of languages, you learn less things because you can't plainly understand the persons in charge of you. In the case of a training period, you don't create work relations that could be necessary for your future. Furthermore, a person who doesn't want to go abroad will not improve his languages, because go studying abroad should be a voluntary choice, that imply motivation. Finally, the coast of abroad studies is very expensive. I'm more in favour of immersive studies, where some lessons are given in other languages than your mother tongue. ",B2,0654.xml

This football match was Liverpool from England aigainst Dortmund from Germany in quarter final from europa chamions league.

As you know in europa champions league every team have to play one match out and there is one more at home. The game i am talking about is the return match which were played at Liverpool. The first game in Germany was 2-2 and for that reason Liverpool has pression of wining the second match. This was an interessting and excited football game i have never seen in my life. Dortmund scored directly after about 10minutes and Liverpool fans were dispointed.

"There are two side of social netwoks in a relationship The first is to be able to speak with your girlfriend or boyfriend whenever you want and whenever they are. For exemple I live in Belgium for the moment but my girlfriend is in Canada for an intership.Thanks to social networks like facebook, skype or hangout we are able to speak to each other on a daily basis. It helps us to miss each other less. The second side of social network is really bad for a relationship. There is a risk to spy on your love one, try to know with who she or he is talking to. The other bad thing about it, it's really time consuming. You see some couple in a restaurent stare at their phone for 10 minutes without talking to each other, and that's really bad ! To sum up, people should try to keep the social networks in mute when you're with your love one. Do not post anything stupid that can jeoprodise your relationship. Use social network when you're away, not together. ",C1,0668.xml
"We could use more sustainable energy as wind , photovoltaic panels and biogas ( for the public transports) for instance, that will be reduce also the price of fees. People could use bike for small distances and ask for carpooling instead of using their car alone. The governments should use alternative energy like the biomass for district heating as in Vakjo (Sweden) where autorities use mostly wood chips from forestry holding but I understand that not every countries have the same resources, so it'll not fit everywhere. I think we really should study the geography of our own country because it's the best way to find in which renewable energy we could improve the technology, and then allow to reach a better sustainable development.

In deed i didn't get it at the beggining but throughout the book i had knew information and i better understood his attitude.

I'm kind of a very romantic girl, so love stories are my faves! Why I do love so much this book? First of all the character of Mr. Darcy is so interesting! He is kind of mysterious and really intrigating. On the other hand, the book is not only based upon a love story, there is so much subject that the author talks about like the gap between poor and rich poeple in the past; how they tend to live etc. Finally the book end in a happy way, and I love happy ends!

If every person makes an effort to reduce his fuel consumption (by going to work by bike instead of taking his car for example). It will surely help us to maintain the pollution level lower. Another possibility is to try to convince people that their is a serious problem with the environment and explain them how they help improve the environment. A third possibility is to vote for politicians who take green energy and the environment in general into consideration.

"I think it's right to say that studying abroad is a compulsary part of the education. We are living in a world where all is more and more open to others civilisations and others countries. So if you you leave your country to study in another country, after or during your studies, during 6 month or a year, you'll have a considerable advantage to begin your career path. Moreover, I think that studying abroad can bring you a lot of things for your personal development. First, you will dicover new civilisations and new ways of living and working. Furthermore, ou can learn new marketing and financial dispositions and you have also a bigger baggage for beginning working.

But let's be honest, money is important too. You just need to find the right balance between those two. Life is about making choices so everyone has to feel what is better to him/her.

Now, this social networking is not enough to have relationship. Relationship without meeting people face to face is not true relationship. How can you trust people without meeting them? Some people are even cheeting and are inventing stories about themselves. Internet is important for communication of course, it is easy to write and send notes to a lot of people but this is not enough to keep true relations. This is my opinion. ",C1,0679.xml
"The best book I've ever read is the seventh book of the Harry Potter serie. I love the entire serie of book, I really love it, even the movies but I prefer the books. The seventh book has always caught me, I've read it several times already, proof that I really appreciate it. I really love the story, and what's happening in this book. It's the end of the whole story, we understand several things we didn't really understand in the previous books. But I can't really explain why I'm so in love with this book, it's kinda weird. I've always been fascinated by the story, the characters, their personality. What happens in the story is really catching, it's never boring or anything. There is always something happening. I really love the way the author wrote this book, it's catching you from the very first page. I could read it several more times I think. ",B1,0123.xml
"To be honnest, I really try to be realistic with my future so I've never imagined my life if I had a million euros so far. But I can try ... I'd begin by building a huge dressing in my house, to wake up the girl in me who dreams about shoes and prom bal. And I would probably stay for one hour each day in it to chose what to wear. Secondly, if I had 1 million euros, I would buy a cosy house in Tenerife for exemple. It would allow me to escape from my life whenever I want, for just a few days ... It can seem selfish because the first things I want to do are for me and not for poor child who are starving ... But I REALLY want a dressing ! ",B1,0137.xml
"It should be but it can't be .why? Studying abroad is a serious advantage,you improve languages and/or other subjects, you discover other ways of living and being, doing so you enlarge your own personnality, abilities, and knowledges. This would be desirable for everybody. But everyone is not able to live such an experiment ; some can't afford the cost of living abroad, health or psychological problems can stop others from travelling . And we must admit that some people are unable to cope with another language and that all jobs don't require languages use. So to be practical, studying abroad should be compulsory for some jobs : interpreters,diplomats...,highly necessary for a most people :engineers,scientists,secretaries but not compulsory when it is not needed ",B2,0651.xml
"Well, basically I think it hasn't a good impact on relationships in general because I can observe many people just spying others, envying them hating them or felling inferior to the other through their computer. I just have the feeling that it makes people even more mental. Also, I did observed many couple being spyed by one of the partner on social media, scared of being cheating or jealous of friends and so, imagined stories and then asking count such ""Who is this person ?"" ""How do you know him  ?""... I also observe many ""faking behaviours"" of people over-acting in there comments and so, to pretend something, Some of them are so obsessed of their image and the way they look like... Posting qgqin qnd qgqin picture of them or of their friends to proof something to the other. In the other hand, other are complaining, gossip, laugh of them, hate them, some like it.... And other behaviour, is the ""Jealous freak control Girl"", I only notice girl doing this, they want to make sure everything knows they are in couple because they fear their boys will go to see someone else, so they pint their territory like a dog on the Facebook wall of the loved one. In fact, they just don't trust at all the boy pretending they love him so much, they just want to possessed him. ",C1,0686.xml
"Generally social networks are like the fire for me. I mean we have to know how to use them in the correct and appropriate way. It is necessary to know that they cannot replace the real relationships, but they can make some part of them much easier. For me social networks are not a problem at all. I can stay in touch with my friends who are living far away. I can see their photos and everything they wanna share with me. At the same time I'm using social networks to arrange the real meetings with my friends. And I have my news feed at the same time which is really very useful. At the same time I'm pretty sure that for some people it is harder to contact with the real world because all their life is going in social networks. And yeah, there's a problem. But I don't know certainly if it is a foal of the social networks. I'm not looking for any excuses here but maybe these people just wouldn't contact with the world at all. I don't know. So there's a conclusion from me. As I said before I think that social networks could be really a great tool, they can be indispensable in some cases, they can give us some great opportunities. But at the same time we have just to use them properly and to add all these possibilities to our life. ",C1,0692.xml
"For me we must find another energy source. Indeed oil and nuclear energy are much consumed and it's very bad for our environment. I think it's a duty to find sources of cleaner energy because it's a very important point for the environment. We must invest in green energy like wind turbines or find an another energy who does not pollute. A lot of things operate thanks to energy so if we can improve this sector, our environment will be better. In conclusion, the governements of each country must give themselves the means to achieve it and must coordinate with each other in order to have meaningful results. ",B2,0309.xml

But then you have to choose : do you want to be depressed to get up everyday, but can buy more things, or do you prefer to have nice days and can be happy even if you own less ? Good paid job is also often a job which asks a lot of time. Money, but no time to use it ?! In my point of view, an enjoyable job is essential in a life. But not all people have this chance.

"One of the biggest problematic issues that the humanity faced today is the preserving of the environment. This issue disturb both economically, and physically. I can completely agree with a Canadian social activist Naomi Klein, that in order to save the planet the drastic measures should be realised. From my point of view, these measures will allow to humanity to understand how it is important to change our lifestyle in favor of the planet. The politicians should take into consideration that all the society must be engaged in resolving of that crucial question. In the interest of changing the society, some social issues should be changed, for instance, the education.

"THIS IS MY WAY First, I think the best way to help the environment is to raise awareness on the issue. Even if global warming and species exctinctions are scientifically proved. Many human being still do not know what it is and when they do, they do not understand how it is important to us, to the survival of our planet as we know it. Then, when people have information they will have the motivation to change things in their way of life. It is a process which need to be done step by step because it is important to keep this fight personnal and to believe in what you do, and not to do it because you were told to do so. Now we can enlist the many options you have to become an environment fighter. The basics are : to decresease the use of oil-propelled energy (bike, public transportation, short shower, pull-over instead of turning on the  heating), sort the waste, eat lower meat, etc. These are some of the choices you could make in your life to help the environment. They are not enlisted here because the efforts to make is infinite and the implementation in your life your own decision. ",B2,0296.xml

No matter how the author could describe things, you can always imagine them as you want.

You won't want to wake up in the morning to do it, you won't find it interesting and it won't teach you anything. Our society tells us that making money is the ultimate goal because that's how you are going to be important in this world, that's how you're going to be happy, to be able to care for your family... I strongly believe that money is important to live a decent life and have a chance at life for all your basic needs. But if you're living a life that you hate trying to make money, what's the point?

Of course, actors, singers and musicians often live thanks to their audience but that doesn't mean the audience has the right to be aware of their every moves! The problem is that people are too curisous. They love to read or hear about drama. That's why tabloid are so popular: people want to read about the last or movie their idol is in, they want to know about their love life, family troubles... In my opinion, everyone's private life must be respected. Those people who live in the public eye are humans above all and should be respected, by living a part of their life out of the stage.

"According to my opinion, I think hat it's far more important to have an enjoyable job rather than a job that makes a lot of money because a job represents lots of hours in our life and, if we don't like or enjoy it, we 'll spend hours and hours working in a job that doesn't satisfy our deep aspirations, we soon will  get bored by it and that is sure to induce complications in our life such as misunderstandings with our family, great discussions after work because someone who isn't satisfied at work, tries to compensate after work. There are many opportunities to compensate and trying to find whatever we can't find in our job: Compensating by doing on sports which sems a good solution. Compensating by eating to much food. Compensating by becoming addict to cigarettes, to drugs,to alcohol, to games in casinos. Becoming addict to games on our personal computers, spending more money than one could afford. Some people become addict to medications, painkillers and so on. I think,that for the time being, we are living in a period where everything goes to quick, to far and to complicated (due to the computers) and we have to cope with it but it's really hard to follow... On the other hand, a  job that brings more money but is boring you every moment, gives you a financial independance but that won't last because sooner or later, we'll get bored by it and the same problems may appear like such I described just above.

"I think that people living in the public eye have the same right to privacy, providing they really want it. There are rules and laws to protect their privacy but most of them have, in the first times, more adavntages to be well known and uses the media for their own usage. If they do so, its more difficult to ask, later, for more privacy because the journalists and the public is used to see them in the media. Nevertheless, there are many well known people who keep a strong distance between their public and their private life and their wish is usually respected by the paparazzi. The problem, nowedays, is that people are very narcissic and thing the only way to exist is to be present in the media, or the internet; while the correct way to exist is to be present in the real society. The media is something very transient where you can make the buzz one day and being forgotten the day after.

"Eating a balanced diet is indeed recommended for a healthy life. This covers what you eat and drink. Doctors use to say that you should eat at least five fruits or vegetables every day. Drinking too much alcohol can be damageable to your body. Men are allowed three alcoholic drinks per day, while women are allowed only two. Whatever the beverage (wine, beer, digestive, ...) the quantity of alcohol is the same in one standard glass, since glasses are smaller for drinks that contain a higher concentration in alcohol. Unfortunately, nothing is black or white: experts also recognize benefits in drinking a reasonable quantity of alcohol. Red wine, for example, is known for its benefits on your blood pressure. It would be too simple if eating a balanced diet was enough to guarantee a healthy life. Practicing sports is also recommended. This starts with simple habits, such as using the stairs insteaf of the lift, or walking a bit instead of systematically using the car. ",C1,0685.xml
"I think study abroad is very important for the education. Students can discover a whole new culture and meet people all over the world. But even more, it can help students to learn a different language and to have clases en that new language. This is really interresting because they can use that language later for their jobs. And most of all, study abroad gives experiences. I personnaly went in Canada for an exchange program and it gave me a lot of experiences. I could learn that the culture is very different from ours, even if it is still an occidental counrty, I also learned the language very well and not to be shy when I try to talk english.

"Though I would have fully agreed with the statement a few years ago, I now believe that the quality of the food is what matters, more than a balanced diet unfortunately. A study has demonstrated that the weight of an average adult nowadays is higher (and not slightly, we speak of a difference of 20kg) than the weight of an average adult in the seventies with a comparable physical activity.  Another study states that in order to ingest the same amount of vitamins than an appel 30 years ago, we would have to eat 30 to 40 appels. Though the balance diet surely helps to live an healthy life, it is thus not in my eyes, the most important factor.  Quality! That what we need.  Food is fuel for our body. The lower the quality of the food, the more we need to ingest in order to reach the needed levels of vitamins and minerals. Our vitality and mood depend on those, but we than endanger our weight!

So thanks our efforts we helped an association. What's adapted diving? It's diving for people with disabilities. We have now in Belgium a blind who is making apnea. ",A2,0529.xml
"As a student, I would be really delighted if I could study abroad and discover new horizons. Travelling bring experience to the students and that can be really useful in the professional life. It gives them a new look to everyday-problem and this new look can help in future decisions making. But these abroad studies would have a cost some students couldn't afford. If these travels were compulsory, it would cost the student or the state. I think that nearly free education is far too expensive for the state to add travels like these. While studying in a foreign country is a necessary experience, it can be a real financial burden. In my opinion, making them compulsory is a bad idea but these academic travels must be facilitate for everyone. ",B2,0273.xml
"Yesterday, I went to a concert ! It was very original because there were not any intruments. It's weird, no? Indeed, there were not intruments because the science was in the place. Four persons made music with domestic things. But what ? For exemple, one of this people made music with a glass of water. Another people played with a lot of boils to replace the drum. It was very original and magic. The science is able to replace different instruments and products different sounds. So, I have one advice for you... Try a science concert ! ",B1,0267.xml

"Social networks such as Facebook can have postive impacts as well as negative impacts on relationships. On the one hand, Facebook can be very helpful to look for friends you've lost sight of. It's always a warm feeling when you find out they did great in life. Also, you can share happy or sad moments of your life and friends can react to it. Another great thing about Facebook is that you can join groups about specific subjects like a singer you love, your hobby or your favorite football team, and meet new people who have the same center of interest as you. I'd like to add that, having many friends living in Paris, I was so relieved, thanks to Facebook app, to know that all of them were safe after the terrorist attacks on 13 November. On the other hand, Facebook is very intrusive in your private life as it knows everything you watch, you do and so on. Also, everything you post on Facebook become Facebook's property which is, in my opinion, definitely abnormal. For some specific public, Facebook can be particularly harmful. For exemple, teens can be bullied online which may sometimes lead to suicide. Also, teenagers are not always aware of the danger of publishing pictures or accepting anyone as a friend. Who knows if this person is a perv! In general, you need to be very careful about what you post and whom they post it to, especially when it concerns you professional or your love life. You don't want your girlfriend to know you cheated on her with Facebook, or your boss to find out you lied about being sick as hell while you were in fact sunbathing in the Bahamas! To conclude, I think social networks like Facebook are double-edged swords. People need to be very careful about what they post and whom they post it to. Parents must control their kids' use of social network to be sure they're safe. Despite these inconveniences, social networks are wonderful to keep in touch with friends or to discover new inspiring and loving people! ",C1,0688.xml
"Yes they have. If I were a ""star"" I would enjoy to meet my fans , to shake hands, to hear how fond they are of   marvellous myself. Just for a short time though, as I would soon get bored to find reporters paparazzis or  excited girls ( this being questionnable... )  ) in my sleepingroom or elsewhere in my house. The main problem for such people is how to preserve their privacy should they  want to . Public eye implies public appearance . A  so-called star is not much by itself, it needs a manager , a financial advisor a marketing staff, just name them. Main point for me is Morality . How to keep a balanced life among the ones who are making a living thanks to me , how to sort the good ones from the others needs a sharp and permanent  control of their job. To keep in mind  some ,perhaps many , are jealous and wish me the worst could help not  to fall  into what  they want me to. This a rather pessimistic comment so far. Politicians, artists, stars are  used to meet  or ought to learn how to cope with ""the publc eye"" . They have power they enjoy high incomes and I agree that many are not  ""rotten"" nor  morons and deserve a  positive mark.

"People who live in the public eye certainly do have a right to privacy. This is a fundamental right of all human beings. However, the reality is probably that this right is not respected. For many famous persons, we see too often private pictures or information relative to intimacy published in tabloids. I cannot imagine that stars, politicians, members of royal families, etc. can go out in any public place without the fear of being recognised. If I were them, I would feel that as a violation of my freedom and of one of the most basic human rights. Medias and fans seem to forget that famous people are as human as they are and that they have the same needs, dreams, fears and hopes as anybody else. Yet, there may be some exceptions: some people who actually like to see their whole life becoming public. They may accept to lose their privacy in the name of glory and fame. But I believe that this is rare and that most famous people actually wish to see their right to privacy respected. ",C1,0662.xml

"Social networks are giving the feeling to have relationships, by sharing informations to 'friends'.  In place of having real contacts with other people, and building real relations, we are sitting in front of our screens, sharing unimportant news to people we don't really know. We have less 'deep' relationships and are staying more and more on artificials connexions.  Sharing where we are, what we do, what we eat, ... to our friends, the friends of our friends and the friends of the friends of our friensd.  At the end, we have thousands persons named 'friends' who can read our informations and see our pictures, ... but no-one where we can go in the middle of the night when we are in trouble and really need help. On the other hand, social networks are an easy way to share very quickly some important information, have very good tools to create a shared agenda to try to find the perfect date for an event. If it is used as a help, taking the advantages of the system and beeing aware of the limits of it, it can be interesting to use. ",B1,0689.xml

"In my opinion, everyone wants to reach happiness. That idea is what drives people throughout their lives, what influences them the most when facing important choices. Now, in a world where capitalism has so deeply spreaded in all aspects of the society that wealth became the principle value by which a person can mesure his success and thus, his happiness, grinding money for the sake of it seems like the rational thing to do. Should {name}, who truly enjoys chess, try to find a chess-related job ? Sure, why not ? But what if this job doesn't provide enough money for her to carry about her future family ? Perhaps she could study chess-related field like mathematics, psychology or computer science and get a job with a bigger salary ? At this point, one could easily argue that she might end up burned out and unhappy with her job, but my main argument here is : the best answer to the question stands in both statements. However, this is also a matter of proportion. Indeed, there is a level beyond which salary by itself has less value that happiness. To conclude, I think that making money is more important as you are less rich, whilst caring for having an enjoyable job is a privilege of wealthier people. ",B2,0272.xml
"On one hand social networks represent a huge contributions to remotelly  located relationships allowing them to keep contact no matter of the distance. On the other hand relationships between people located at the same place might suffer because of the attention we are putting in monitoring our social network and remote relationships forgetting to take advantage of the actual presence in front of us at the very real space and time where we are. In addition, social networks enables us to stablish relationships with people we would not met in normal life because of the distance or because they are belonging to different social groups. Nevertheless, this social network are creating less deeper and very fragile relationships exchanging about superfluous matters, while with real presence relationships subjects of discussion tend to be more profound and longuer and more stable relationships. We must know how to take advantage of these new social networks while reserving some time for real time and space relationships. The first is a only a ""tool"", the second ""real life"". ",B2,0702.xml
"Do social networks have an impact on relationships? Yes, they do. Another question would be to define the kind of relationships which are affected. According to me social networks can either damage relationships or make them feel more real than they actually are. Let's take Facebook as an illustration. If you count your ""friends"", you will be quite surprised about the number you reach. Some questions may be raised after doing this: are they all really my friends? would I invite them to my birthday (personally, the result was 53 people out of 181 contacts), would I talk to them on a daily basis/if I met them in the street/if there wasn't that particular common friend? I can therefore say that a lot of relationships are way more than they actually are thanks to, or because of, social networks. In terms of damaging relationships, social networks can be of advantage to two sorts of people; sneaky ones and inferiority complex-sufferers. For the former, let's say that privacy is not the strong point of that kind of media. You can see everything people allow you to see and you can even know when someone ignores you (thanks to the wicked ""seen"" indactor). For the latter, you only have to listen to the news to see the number of youngsters that commit suicides after being bullied on social networks. Before bullying was the matter of school: children intimidating others and so on. Nowadays, pupils take this back at home when school is over. The only place where they felt safe is now invaded by their everyday problem, which leads, inevitably, to drastic results. I guess social networks are not the best thing that happened in our era. However they offer the advantage of being fast (e.g. to reach a ""friend"") and convenient (e.g. to share pictures). ",C2,0700.xml

"My opinion has to be qualified . I think it is important to take care of her/his family and especially the children who do not ask to be put in the spotlight. It is necessary to protect them and not to expose them in front of a camera. For this reason, people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy. (63) On the other hand they have to give legal information if they belong to a political party or have responsibilities at the government level. For example, it is relevant to know their property and if they do not evade the tax. Another point is to be sure they have no problem with law. However this kind of information is normaly private. But public people have to give this private information and the right to privacy is cancelled.(77) It is a delicat subject to define what it must be given or not to the public eyes. ",B2,0674.xml

"I don't totaly agree with that point of view. For sure, eating a balanced diet is necesary for a healthy life, but it is not enough. Sport is very important too. It is not necessary to work out intensivly but people need to be moving. It is very unhealthy to stay sit all day long, even if you have an healthy diet. Scientists found out that staying sit all day long is very dangerous and that it kills a lot of people every year, just like smoking ! Moreover it is also very important not to party too much, not too drinkg too much alchool. According to me, an other important factor is the way you feel inside. For an healty life, you got to feel good in your head, to be happy, to be possitive and to enjoy life. So for an healthy life, you need a balanced diet, you need to be working out and you need to be possitive about your life. Those are the ingredients for an healthy life. ",B2,0660.xml

It's not up to other ppl to decide if your private life is for consumption and entertainment, that should always be under your own control and stay your own choice. Most times those want to get private information about ppl in the public eye don't have any other motivation for it aside from being bored.

"To me a healthy lifestyle starts with eating in a healthy, balanced way. It is of utter importance because food is what fuels your body. If you use the wrong fuel for your car, you won't be going very far! It's the first step towards overall well-being and a healthy body. If you eat healthily, you'll feel better and you'll be more inclined to take on physical activities and sports, as you know that your body is ready to make such efforts. But it is also the first step towards overall well-being; as they say, a healthy mind in a healthy body! If you feel good in your body, you'll feel good on a psychological level. And contrarily to popular belief, it is actually quite easy to eat in a healthy but also enjoyable way. Healthy doesn't have to mean boring, tasteless food. You can just go on the internet and find healthy yet tasty alternatives to your everyday dishes. It might also be vegetarian, or even vegan, which is also a good thing since it's a more responsible, eco-friendly way of eating.

"I would try to convice poilitics that our productions's method is way less efficient than other methods. As an example, permacultural production of food which try to work with the nature instead of working against, has already prooved his ability to feed a good amount of population without causing any damages to the nature we're living in. It goes even more than than the only production of food. Indeed, the idea is to help the nature by recreate nice conditions for her to expand herself. This method is a good response to deserts due only to abusive deforestation. We can apply this method for ourserlves, but the deal is becoming so much important that we have to implicate politics into that matter. It might be hard, as this new method can't be used for big marchandizing and only work at local level.

"I totally agree with this sentence. In fact, if you want to be fit, a balanced diet is more important than doing sport only. But being fit is not the only purpose in life. A good diet keeps you in shape, lively, awake... It brings you everything you need ( vitamins, calcium, ... ) and keeps away illness. It's ok to eat some fast food from time to time but it mustn't be a habit. Of course you have to drink a lot of water too, it's the only liquid you need to survive. It's important to avoid sodas and you need to control your alcohol comsumption. Having a balanced diet for me is to eat everything, to vary your meals, to eat a lot of vegetables, and if you can buy local products it's even better.

"The environment, our contemporary green gold, is key for human life, and after many years of drawing resources, the mankind has realised it is really necessary to stop this massacre until it becomes irremediable.

I would also encourage inhabitants from developed countries first, as they are more disposed financially to make efforts, to compost and plat trees in their garden and to sort out their wastes more consciously. As farmming has a big impact on our planet, it is an emergency to get people conscious about the need they decrease thei meat consumption. Though we already have observed changes, I would encourage financially companies, universities, schools that promote the right attitude and invest in and implement efficient autonomous facilities and the use of ecological products.

In fact, both would be perfect... But in my opinion if you don't feel good when you are at work and if you don't even want to go to work when you get up, then it's a real problem because that could have really huge consequences on your personal life. My point of view is that when you don't feel good at work, you don't feel good in life. A lot of companies don't care about how their employees feel at work. They only think about making profit instead of caring about people. The worst is that some people become depressive because of their work. And being depressive can lead to suicide.

"Yes, there should be a separation between private and professionnal life. Even tough a part of some people's job is to be famous, well knowned, and therefore being seen, they should have the right to a private life.

"I think that following classes abroad should be a compulsory part of education. Firstly, we live today in a globalize world where everyone are interconnected. Most of the student now will work with people coming from around the world in their professional life. For those reasons, it's important to be open-minded and to be aware of the existence of different cultures. Secondly, studying abroad can give you a different point of view of a same topic. So, expecially as an academic student, it's necessary to see all the side of a subject. For example, following a class of industrial organization in Louvain-la-Neuve will no be the same as following the same lesson in Beijing. To conclude, thirty years ago the barriers to go studying abroad were the price of the trip and of the registration in the other insitution. Today those problems don't exist anymore: it's cheap to travel and instutions, like universities, have more and more contact between them so that the price of the inscription has reduced a lot.

Some pieces of advice will be given to adopt an eco friendly behaviour. First, I think everybody could make something at his own level.

It is aso possible to buy food in cooperatives or bio food to avoid some longs travels around the world which are very pollutives. Second, some  little habits have to be changed. For instance, it is better to take showers than baths or to use his washmachine during the night, to switch off the ligts when you leave a place. It is little things that seems to be not usefull or not enough but that could have an effect indeed. Finally, some pieces of advices had been given. Some of them are concerned consumption and other our habits. It is just little things but if everyone take this into account, it could have a big impact. ",B2,0314.xml

"My answer to this question is yes, famous people do have a right to privacy. Artists, actors, musicians, politicians (and so on) don't need every single aspects of their life known and shown to the whole world. The only thing that should matter is if these people do their job right. As long as they don't break any rule, why should we know who they married and what their children look like or if they cheated,... Furthermore, media making money by invading privacy are often terrible. Examples of this are tabloids or reality show like the Kardashians. That is not good TV. It's getting harder and harder for celebrities to keep their private life private, with the increase of social media and everybody owning a camera phone. We should put ourselves in their shoes and ask us how we would like to be treated if we were in their place. ",C1,0704.xml
"We all have a right to privacy, people in the public eye aren't an exception, but the extent of their privacy depends on the function they have. There are limits to privacy for people in the public eye, nonetheless. A politician should have the right to go on holiday and live with his or her family without people snooping on them, but must remain open when excercising their public functions. Celebrities should be allowed to be left alone as long as they attempt to remain anonymous, but they waiver that right when they try and use their influence as a public figure to gain specific advantages. Notorious Criminals in the public eye should also expect to lose alot of their rights to privacy- personal rights end when the rights of others are compromised. It is therefore very important to define what constitutes ""the public eye"" but also what constitutes ""privacy"". ",C2,0706.xml

Furthermore, going overseas is a way to improve the language but it also a way to learn to be ressourceful, responsive and blooming.

"Privacy is indeed a right. The reasons why someone may be in the public eye are varied, but they should be the only things we are allowed to know. If you are an actor, a politician, a musician or a writer you already give yourself to the eye of the society. The public is the way they earn their lives, but that doesn't mean they are parasites and therefore that we have the right to penetrate their intimacy. They have agreed to share a bit of themselves but that bit should only be what they feel comfortable about and shouldn't be much more than what they are doing for instance a musician can talk about something personnal to explain a song or a politician can explain why a subject is close to his heart,and that should be it. People who are thirsty of more and more about personnal business of others are broken inside,unsatisfied about their lives and they need to fulfill  their daily routine with drama or they like to feel clever when watching dumb and spoilt people in their own little meaningless lives. Thus, privacy is a right but not every person in the public eye wants it, some people just want to be rich and famous and will show no mercy to their integrity and because of those people, others have to go through unnecessary awkward and though situations to keep their lives out of the eyes. At the time of social media, the lack of privacy touches everyone, we do not know the boundaries of it anymore, so if you already know everything about your best friend's cousin then why is it so wrong to know all about this famous person that knowingly put himself in the public eye? On the other hand, I do think that being famous is also having to be honest and respectful. So if something happens and has a pubic impact on your work, you have to explain a little bit of it. But yet again, details are not needed. In conclusion, privacy is a right and the lack of it as well, what's mostly important is what the person wants, but it is well known that when giving a little bit, people always want more. Accordingly, people who live in the public eye will always have to put their private life a little bit in the light with them, but they should never have to show more than needed or beyond their comfortable limits ",B2,0699.xml
"Social networks can impact relationships at different levels. First of all, they can serve as upgraded address books that allow people to remain connected even if life has separated them. Social networks also allow people to stay closer as they can stay away while remaining aware of their friend's whereabouts. On the other hands, social networks might hinder or slow down the creation of new friendships as, when embedded in a new environment, protagonists might decide to stay connected to their 'old' friends and not open up as fast. Also, being connected through social networks might give the false impression of knowing people while what we have access to is only a distilled and strongly editer version of people's lives. Lastly, social networks might be able to create relationships which otherwise would physically not have been possible. For example, a young Australian boy living in the Outback whose passion is astronomy might be able to get in touch with a girl from Iran who dreams to become an astronaut. Overall, social networks reshape our relationships by altering the distances as we know them and creating a new canvas where the world looks much smaller. ",C2,0672.xml

"At first, we can consider social network as an easy way to keep in touch with other people (for instance : friends from childhood, close ones living far away...), as well as a manner to discover new people ""by chance"" on the internet enabling us to widen our circles. We could then conclude that social network has positive impacts on relationships. However, we can easily observe in our daily lives that people tend to lock themselves more and more in their house to communicate only by messages through internet which reduces the frequency of real conversations ""face-to-face"". Besides, there's also the persecution problem which happens a lot more often than we all think and which has already caused deaths of lots of teenagers. . In one word, I believe that social networks could be beneficial for relationships with some limits. Indeed what I fear the most is the loss of human contact. Using social networks with moderation shouldn't represent any problems. The last thing to keep in mind whatever we do it is :"" My liberty ends when others' starts"". ",B2,0667.xml
"My opinion is that there are MANY factors responsible for being healthy or not. In order to be healthy one needs to pay close attention to one's life habits: eating well but also getting enough sleep, having regular exercise, drinking enough water and avoiding excessive consumption of coffee, alcohol or tobacco. Being satisfied with your life, especially as concerns the relationship(s) and professional areas, is also extremely important. So I tend to disagree with the above sentence as it tends to give the impression that eating healthily is (almost) enough, while I believe what makes one healthy is the right (and balanced: ""Who lives without folly is not as wise as (s)he thinks"") combination of factors. So if someone has many good habits but does not eat very healthily, that person might well be healthier than someone who eats very healthily but does not sleep enough, is not happy with one's life and generally speaking has a high level of stress.

The landscape are also astonishing; sometimes, you had the feeling to be on the Moon, alone. We were also surprised by the sheeps. There are a lot of sheeps everywhere. But unlike in Belgium where they live in groups, in Iceland, they live by group of three, the mother and two baby sheeps. Everywhere, if you see one sheep, the two others are not far away!

"Social networks tends to create a distance between people, but paradoxally it is also a very good way to keep in touch with friends and family abroad. I would say that the impact of social network on relationship depend very much on how it is used, that comment is true for most of the new communication technology that are spreading nowadays. Considering social network as facebook or instagram, the impact on people's life can be quite important. For the persons who are particularly influencable (such as teenagers for example) seeing too many images of the same kind (thin models, beautiful holiday pictures,...) that reflect a life that is, most of the time, only superficial and unrealistic can be devastating on their self-esteem and the value they give to their lifes. Adults are of course also concern by this impact, especially those who are already experimenting trouble such as depression and self-depreciation. On the other hand, social networks are an efficient media for communication, it allows to share things that we would have never shared before, andto anyone arround the globe. The respect of personal privacy is actually an other issue that can be pointed out when we take social networks in consideration, but that fact has less todo with the impact it can have on relationships.

"Nowadays, thanks to the many progresses in the medecine sector, people are far more aware that their health is highly linked with what they eat. First of all, eating a balanced diet protects you from many kinds of disease, such as heart attack or many sort of cancers. Fruits and vegetables are well known for their curative power, and the protection they offer against the aforementionned diseases. Take for instance brocolis : people who eat brocolis at least once a week are likely to have a longer life and are   immuned against some cancers. Moreover, some food, like fish, are said to make people more clever, and more able to think, calculate and work. A person who eats fish regularly will see his skills increase considerably, he will be more able to produce an efficient and reliable work. Finally, people are more enthusiastic and dynamic to practise sport when they are healthy, and to be healthy they need to eat a balanced diet. It is therefore like a vertuous circle, and people will feel more confortable with their body. To conclude, the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that people's health is clearly related with what they eat. It is really important to be cautious with what you eat, as some food have detrimental effects on yourself, whereas others can make you live longer. ",B2,0402.xml
"Well, I guess that social networks allow people to maintain more relationships than before, even though these relationships are less consistent than those in real life. But still, people can get information about ""friends"" they won't meet again anytime soon. This leads to what we could call a feeling of knowing about these people. In fact, social networks users tend to expose their life, and it allows their contacts to know way more than what they would know if their relationship didn't include social networks. But in my opinion, social networks are useful tools to maintain social contacts. You can use them to get in touch with old friends, to invite people to an event of yours in an easier way or to keep tuned about your friends' news in a more efficient way. All you have to do is browse an application or a webpage and in an eyeblink you can get informations that you would have got with a dozen of phone calls and a hundred of texts - or even worse, letters.

"Social networks are certainly gaining an important place in our lives, we are now able to contact our family and friends insanely fast thanks to Facebook ,Twitter allows us to follow people and firms' activities on a daily basis, while Instagram rallies a community of photographs' lovers. Now, how did we react to such big changes over the last decade ? One undeniable fact is that people are now using these networks to stimulate their social life, some people now prefer to chat on the internet instead of going out and get to know their neighbours a little better. We now tend to have a closer relationship with our computer or smartphone than we have with our friends. This accounts for a lot of direct and indirect consequences. Firstly, our body is not quite used to watching a ""blue"" screen all day, hence the need to put down your tablet or smartphone before going to sleep if you don't want to stay awake for a few more hours and be tired the next day which could affect the relationship with your family or colleagues. Second, most people would agree that the internet has affected the way we spend our free time. As a matter of fact, while my grandfather walked two miles to the cinema to watch the latest movie with some friends or played tennis on a sunny afternoon, I find it more easy to download the latest hit or surf on the internet all day. In closing, I would recommend to think about how the internet and the social networks have affected our lives and how we want it to evolve in the next few years.

"I personally think it is more important to have an enjoyable job than to make money. Of course everybody needs money to live but we don't need to live for money. On the other hand, if somebody spends the whole day at work, this has to be pleasant and interesting.  The job itself first and also the colleagues. - Through the job first, you may learn a lot of things, new matters for instance, new ways to work.  By working with foreigners (abroad), it makes you openminded. Working hard may also bring a lot of stress of course - Then if you share your time with nice colleagues, this can help you in case the job is less interesting.  You are still happy when you are going to work. Unfair colleagues cause today of lot of problems (especially psychological ones).

"In my opinion, traveling abroad is the best way to learn a language. First of all, it's incredibly faster than in your own country because you have to speak non-stop in the other language. Moreover, speaking with native speakers increase your listening and speaking skills in a real conditions of living. For exemple, I went to Canada during 4 months and I learnt more than what I studied while I was at school in Belgium.

Now, we can easily get in contact with anybody, anywhere, at any time. Nowadays, social networks are everywhere. We can share every single moment of our life and communicate with the entire world. However, by using this kind of social networks, people are creating a virtual world. They stay alone, behind a screen and there are always interrupted with notifications. Moreover, we are humains and interactions are very important for our development. The internet breaks real interactions and brings people in a virtual world, a world of illusion, a world with no mercy, a ""fake"" world. Indeed most people do not make any distinction between the real world and the virtual one. To conclude, social networks change our way of thinking, our way of living. We have to stay as human as possible and keep real interaction alive. There is much more to learn about the real world. ",B2,0417.xml
"I've always thought that the way we stalk actors, models and even celebrities we don't even know why we do know them, like Kim K, is one of the creepiest hobbies of the human kind. There is strictly no reason why we should know Orlando Bloom's first baby's name, or what did Jennifer Anniston ate yesterday, ... So yes, to me, they definitly should have a right to privacy because it can drive you crazy to be constantly followed by paparazzis and fans, every step you take is watched by someone, every mistake you do is recorded. That's a terrible life. But we can say that, in a way,  the only reason why they still live in the public eye, why they're still celebrities, is because of the huge work of journalists and admirors... How would they exist to us if no one make them famous by talking about them? That's the exact mind-tricking issue. We don't even realise anymore they're a part of our lifes and we know them better than we think. For example, Leonardo Di Caprio. Let's imagine I saw only one of his movies, and I don't particuliary watch TV so I don't hear a lot about him but I'm on Facebook; I'm still attacked by funny pictures, web articles, informations about him that I don't especially want to know. At the end of one hour of Facebook, I already know that he won his first Oscar, that he divorced like 5 times, that he's actually on a boat with some gorgeous model and that he loves coffee. It's like advertising; you can barrely escape from it. Now there's the part when they know that they're recorded, that they choose to stay in the light instead of the shadows, because that's their best chance to earn more and more money, being chosen because of their celebrity for movies and stuffs... So the real question is: do they claim a right to privacy? That's up to them. ",B2,0365.xml
"Social networks have grown to become a huge part of our everyday lives and have completely changed the way we interact with people around us. It can be seen that people tend to spend more time speaking with their friends and relatives over the internet than meeting them in real life. Furthermore, social networks are all about speed and instantaneous exchanges. We want everything to be shorter in order to go faster, including our relationships. We are talking to our friends online but at the same time we want the conversation to be over so that we can move on to something else. Online conversations are deprived from the willing of communicate and truly interact with somebody else. In addition to that, time spent together in real life also happens to be polluted by social media. It is common to witness friends seated together although both are staring at their smartphones instead of talking to each other. They are spending their together time alone, focussing on their virtual lives. It can be concluded that social networks have had an impact on our relationships, making them shorter online and making us lonelier in real life. ",B2,0359.xml

"According to my opinion, an enjoyable job is more important than a job that brings more money even if we need money to cope with life. I think that when we are working on an enjoyable job, we are more satisfied with our life when coming back in the evening, we don't worry about lots of points that make induce questioning about the aim of our existence. A job that brings money may surely seem like being more reassuring . But, when someorne executes a job that he has chosen in full awareness and with interest, he seems to be less fed up with his daily obligations. He will execute his duties with a light heart and a good energy. Only this is really satisfying and grateful when he comes home and there is no reason to worry about the usefulness of his existence. Executing ones work wtih  a light heart and pleasure seems far more easy and satisfying, there is no reason to worry about lots of useless questions. This person, that enjoys his job and copes wih everything his job requires, has  a real merit doing everything his job requires. When this person needs more money, he is even able to find a complementary source of incomes because he or she isn't fed up by his or her current job.

Relationships  are made easier with new members, it is easier to get new contacts because anyone can talk with somebody on diffrent social networks. I we want to have a conversation with someone at a thousand miles away, it is now possible. We can now almost have an immediate respone to our questions simply by using any social network. Moreover, the developpement of diffrent networks and the advantage of having several networks is that we can sort out our contacts into many social networks like for instance a close friends' network or a colleagues' social network. Unfortunately, the rising of social networks have not only induced good effects. Indeed, social networks have made real human contacts less frequent since it is now possible to be connected without being in front of each other. People tend now to chat online instead of go visiting their friends of contacts. They prefer now the internet to communicate rather than have a face to face conversation. As a result, people tend to stay at home and don't go see their good or old friends anymore, they just keep in thouch via social networks. That proves well social networks have benefits but that proves also that people should be carefull not to use them too often. ",B2,0367.xml
"I think the most important is to feel happy with your work, whatever your salary. Why earn money if you feel miserable and depressed ? In my opinion, that isn't the recipe of the happiness. Money is just a sheet of paper with numbers onto it, it's just silly to think money is a goal. Money is just a tool which is important to build your project alone. You don't need money if you've a lot of friends because your friends can helps you too. If you want to earn a lot of money, you can try Monopoly with your friends. You'll preserve your health, your good mood and your friend. ",B1,0603.xml
"If I had 1 million euros, I would first of all put them in investments that will make my old days better. Then, I would visit all the world with my family to discover new cultures and food.I also would stop to work and enjoy of my free time by making some sports, journeys and by being with my friends. Of course, il would every year give a part of this amount of money to charitables. And when I will have done this, I would buy excitings cars and a chalet in mountains so that I can enjoy the winter by skiing and the summer by sunbathing and making some walks into the wild.

"First, it's important to modify our behaviour when we have to move ! Nowadays, the car is the easier mode of locomotion but this is not the best. Public transports are a good solution. The problem is that these public transports aren't well organized. When you want to go to a big city, you can note that there are not enough parkings near the stations, the underground, then you go further with your car... And another problem of public transports is the lack of fiability, the failure to respect timetables, they are too often late so the people are discouraged and they return to their cars... Another point that could be improved is the household waste. When we go to the supermarket, too much products are packed with plastic. Before, paper was used to pack goods and paper is recycable, that's a better solution, it's the same with the bottles, too much are also in plastic material and that's difficult to recycle.

"As far as I am concerned, I indeed think that studying abroad should be a compulsory part of education. However when I say ""education"", I mean higher school or university. Whatever three or five years, every student should spend at least six months abroad. First and foremost, from a personal point of view, it allows the student to be out of his confort zone which is a essential step in every life. It forces the youth to discover another culture, sometimes even another language, enabling him to come back in his country more open-minded, critical, aware of what happening outside of his borders. From a educational point of view, it makes possible for the student to be conscious about another way of studying. With regard to my experience, I made my university exchange in Peru. There the system was quite different than the Belgian one. Whereas Belgian universities don't give students an ongoing work, the Peruvian requirements were higher along the whole year. I had to work every week which enables me to be ready for the exams whitout being forced to study a lot the week before. For those reasons, studying abroad should be compulsory for everyone as long as it makes you happier. ",B2,0616.xml
"I believe that the impact of social networks on relationships can be both positive and negative, indeed, thanks to this new technology we have access to new ways of interacting with each other. Even if social networks can be useful some times, for example, in a long distance relationship these networks can also be damaging for the couple. As an example, Nowadays, if someone wants to proof its love, he will no longer need to write long poems, or buy flowers. Love has been reduced to something as simple as uploading a picture of you and your partner and write a romantic caption. Nevertheless, not everything is negative social networks can be very positive to romantic relationships, but more precisely, to friendships. Indeed, social networks keep us connected to our beloved and give us the opportunity to be updated with the latest news. Social networks can make us feel as if we were just next to our people even if we are kilometers away. ",B2,0366.xml
"The most important factor of a healthy life When confronted to the question of how to lead a healthier life, it is imperative to talk about the diet we choose to impose on our bodies, and the effects we seek to obtain through it. A healthy life is acquired through a series of disciplined habits, eating healthy is only one of those. it would be interesting to ask ourselves what aspect of our health we wish to improve. Whether it is our weight, our cholesterol, our body's acceptance of certain vitamins, the way we eat plays an important role. However, for this purpose, eating a balanced diet must usually be combined with a healthy exercise routine. While exercising, an important amount of toxins is eliminated and our metabolism is accelerated. Thus, it is safe to conclude, that eating a balanced diet is essential to leading a healthier life, but it will achieve better results if accompanied by a daily exercise routine. ",C1,0414.xml

"Everyone would agree on the fact that we have to develop a healthy lifestyle but according to me eating balanced is not always the most important factor. First of all I do think that there is not only one factor of a healthy life.

The definition of an healthy life is that we live healthy in every aspect of our life and there is not especially a factor that is more essential than the others. In a more personal point of view I tend to thnik that eating whatever you want (in reasonnable limits) is less important than eating just what you need. Furthermore I am convinced that doing sport is also an essential factor because if you eat without thninking to your diet but if you do a lot of sport, you will have a healthier lifestyle than eating properly without any sport. To conclude, I would say that obviously having a balanced diet is a factor of an healthy lifestyle but that's not the most important.

"Do, nowadays, our relationships depend on social networks ? As everyone knows, social networking is part of our lives and for some of you it is pretty about your life. The world is fully connected, you can find anything anywhere on the Internet. You can also see and talk with people instantly all over the world. You have access to worldwide news and much more information. About social networks impacting on our lives, these should be certainly used with moderation, they should not be interfeering with our social life until cutting off our real social life. If used with wisdom and carefulness, these social networks are very usefull and meaningfull when organization is needed, for example : at the university, everyone can share course notes, information about schedules, etc. In conclusion, social networks are really convenient in everyday's life if used correctly and not too frequently. Still keep in mind to have a real social life with friends and family. Do not let technology take over your life. ",B2,0376.xml
"Social networks are present for even everybody in our civlization and particulary for people between 14 and 35 year old. Social networks have consequences in different ways and one of the most important way is the relationships. This is what I will speak about. Firstly, a relationship is something that people live differently. Some people juste like to have very good friends and others like having a huge range of friends. According to me, social networks have an impact for both kind of people and have controversed impacts. It allows people to be all the time connected with their friends even with friends that we can not see everyday! And you can take care of your really good friends everyday. Moreover, with social networks, contacts are easier and that helps some people to have relationships. In fact, it isn't easy for everybody to make friends and sometimes it's easier to start chatching behind a computer. This is a good impact of social networks but these people don't have to forget to see their friends, to have real activities and not be all the time behind the computer. However, with social networks, people are all the time connected. The can even never juste make a break at the end of the day and just forget their problems. Problems follows people in their house, in their bed in all their live. I think that this is a big consequence for jonger people. Somethimes things don't happend goodly at school or with their friend and it follows them everywhere. To conclude, social networks bring a lot in relationship for people. It allows them to have friends and to be connected. But being continually connected has sometimes bad consequences and can make people unhappy by bringing their problems at home. We absolutly have to be carefully with social networks and to use it in a right and good way that makes us feel good. ",B2,0410.xml
"In the last decade, there has been considerable debate over the right to privacy. Some people advocate an absolute right to privacy. Other objects it arguing that it is the price to pay when you are a famous person. Whilst I believe that there are strong arguments on both sides, I would suggest that people who live in the public eye deserve some privacy concerning their private life. The relatives of these people should be protected and some informations on their private life shouldn't appeared in the media. Indeed, some people don't choose to be notorious. In my view, everybody should have the right to choose which information can be revealed to the world. With the new technologies, the expansion of the press and the social media, there have been to much abuses in our modern society. It is normal that the justice protects these rights and punishes the ones who revealed information on people without their agreement. In conclusion, although I accept that some information over notorious people are made known to everybody, I feel that we must have first their permission. ",B2,0362.xml

"In order to take a stance on that statement, it is necessary to give a more accurate definition of the word ""privacy"". According to me, the right to privacy relates to the possibility, not of hiding some of our actions, but to be able to live without having  judging eye following us in our thoughts and deeds. With that in mind, it can possibly be stated that privacy is a necessary condition for freedom. It is indeed very unlikely to feel totally free while knowing everyone is watching. Consequently, I think this right has to be granted to every single human being, even to those whose lives are relentlessly exposed to the public. Furthermore, I think popular people should be able to decide wheter they some bits of their lives to be made public or not. In our communication-based society where scandals are a very profitable resource, it is of course more and more difficult for those people to keep the most private areas of their life away from greedy journalists looking for their next juicy headlines.Therefore, I think some ethical charter of journalism must be set up to prevent those people to have their lives outrageously exposed and (mis)judged by the public.

"The balance diert : According to my opinio, there is different factors to take in consideration for a healthy life. However, a blanced diet has a major importance due to its link with others factors. The balance dier has to be considered as one of the most important factor because the alimentation will be linked to the immunity system. A person who had a complex alimentation will not suffer of poorest alimentation diseases. If the person fows a dier, he must take in consideration the content of his food like sugar, fat, proteun etc. to avoid irregularities. By the way, having a balancer diet will help to keep the weight to an acceptable level. If the balanced diet is well done, the person will reach a weight that match with his objectives. Furthermore, the weight will be influence by physical activities that need a good alimentation to be efficient. We can considerer that the balanced diet has a determinant role in the healthy life due to its implication with most of human's activity to keep a healthy life. ",B1,0363.xml
"It is probably true to say that people living in the public eye have a extraordinary life. Some people even argue that they are living a dream. However, I am doubtful about the true quality of living of people exposed in public. Of course celebrity might be tempting because it brings attention and opens many locked doors. Nonetheless, being constantly observed by curious and intrusive persons is just the tip of the iceberg. Their whole life is examined and judged by envious people. Who has never dreamed of being a star, a politician that has a huge influence on mass media and who can defend their opinion pubicly? I am persuaded that it is a feeling we have all had at least once in our life. Notwithstanding, we tend to only see the bright side of a public function. Indeed, these people have no right to privacy or quite few: grocery shopping, sightseeing, taking their children to school are basic things celebrities cannot do peacefully. Of course stars make mistakes, but who does not ? The only difference is that their mistakes are judged and analized by pseudo-experts who think they will have a perfectly non reprehensible life. I must say that most of us are hypocritical when we judge notorious people since we often make the same mistake than them. In conclusion, I am truely convinced that people living in the public eye need and should have a right to privacy. I am scared that a lack of private life could have a dramatic outcome like the ones we have known in the past ",C1,0377.xml
"For starters, social networks have spread the ease to communicate and to meet new people. Thus, the feeling that it generates can often be of mistrust. Furthermore, the problem acutes when all the information is published and is able to be seen by anyone. Moreover, social networks often make relationships pend form a thread given that acces is not restrincted and when so, the closest people are surely going to be able to see posts, comments, pictures, etc. Hence, it is problably better to keep one distanced from social networks at a certain scale. Finally, social networks can also be a tool to enhance relationships when it comes to sharing ones love and interests. It can enhance the way one can get to know someone else, it's behavior with friends, family and/or colleages. Social networks are, hence, a complex tool that can work for or against relationships, this is why it has always been a polemic topic. ",B2,0411.xml
"""We are what we eat."" Everyone knows this sentence but yet our alimenation has never been so unhealthy. Buying, cooking and eating an healthy food could appear like an impossible challenge and it is easier to eat prepared meals but this food contains a lot of fat and sugar which can have desastring impacts on our health at the long term. People who don't have a balanced diet say they don't have any time, not enough money or any cooking skills. Let's see if these reasons are good or not. Eating a good and balanced food is not expensive. In fact, it's even less expensive than buying prepared meals. Making is own food in the garden is barely free and buying food in local of organic farms could cost more money but the quality of the products is far more higher. Now everybody can cook. On internet you find pieces of advice, videos and forums where you can learn how to cook everything. Isn't a dream to taste a home-made bread, vegetables or even an home-made cheese ! Learning how to cook all these products is possible for everyone ! Cooking is own meal takes time but what are you doing when you put your pizza in the oven ? What are you doing when your fishsticks are in the microwave ? We save time when we eat prepared meals but does this saved time really useful ? Making is own food is a social, funny and calming activity which is the best way to end a hard day of work. In conclusion, there is no real reason to eat prepared and fast food.

"We are tought to have a balanced diet early in life but the society in wich we live has a tendency to make us eat whatever is advertised the most. Be eat fast food, lots of sugar-base product and a lot of meat. Given these factors we have to make an important effort to achieve a healthy lifestyle. The importance of eating a balanced diet can be seen by the multiple advantages it procures. First eating a well balanced diet give the energy to go through your everyday life without feeling weak. It can also reduce the risk of having deadly disease as cancer. In most of the case, keeping a healthy lifestyle also reduces the impact we have on the environement.

"It's probably true to say that eating a balanced diet is a key factor for a healthy life. Some people may refer to the well known sentence ""Mens sana in corpore sano"". Needless to say, the first step to be healthy is to eat well. However, I am not sure that a balanced diet is the most important goal to have an healthy life. Firt of all, diet can very fast become a source of stress when people attach to much importance to it. Clearly we all know someone whi is a diet freak. Secondly, nowadays it is hard to find easily healthy products which are affordable. Indeed, eating good products has a price. Furthermore, there are many others factors to take into account when we talk about healthy life. I tend to think that sport contributes to have a healthy life as much as a balanced diet. I do not mean by this that sport is the most important factor but it sure is essential to be in good shape. Meanwhile, I am convinced that people who care about eating variate and healthy are more enclined to have a healthy life.

While I accept that eating a balanced diet is very important I feel that there are a lot of orther factors to take into account. ",B2,0413.xml
"Nowadays, more and more people tend to think that the internet and social networks are a good way to socialize and meet new people.  However, in my opinion the social networks isolate people who use it. It is generally accepted that when you use the internet or social networks, you can easily meet people and speak a lot with them.  Nevertheless, I think that is fake.  In front of your computer you can't see the emotion that your friends have on their face.  The better way to socialize and to talk to people is in a bar, your sport club or other activities.  For instance, when you have a hassle with a friend it's better to talk face to face.  Indeed, on your computer you have the time to think what you'll respond.  Face to face you have to react directcly I find it better. Moreover, I would argue that social networks and the internet can be very dangerous.  Indeed, some people are weakly and other people are stronger in their mind.  The internet is a good way for those stronger people to threaten the weak people who prefer using the internet because they're shy. However, sometimes the internet can have a positive impact on relationships.  Indeed, that's the easiest way to speak and socialize.  Indeed, you can't always see people.  Then, your smartphone is in your pocket in you can easily talk to a friend who's maybe abroad. To sum up, I will say that social media can have positive and negative impacts.  we have to be very carefully when we use social media if we want its to have positive impacts.  Internet can be easily misused and some people can be hurted.  However, we have to adapt our way of life in this new world with all that technologies. ",B2,0375.xml

You want to buy some healthy food, like Gluten  free cookies or veggies for example, it's way too expansive for the average population, meanwhile the rest is so cheap that it becomes the best alternative. So no one teach to those girls who feel awful in their body how to proceed and what's the key; I really think teaching how to have a balanced diet should be a priority in education, people should learn that the way to feel good is to eat enough and well, but healthy, and stop watching those unrealistic models we have such as actors, Instagram addicts and others. I suffered of that for a long time and there wasn't anyone to tell me i wasn't looking at things the right way. So again, yes it's really important, for the ones who can't afford healthy food (what should be available to everyone) and for the ones who don't accept themselves the way they are, we need to learn what exactly is a balanced diet. My apologies if I didn't answered the way you were expecting me to. ",B2,0412.xml

"Some people argue that celebrities don't have a right to privacy but I am not sure that is the only part of the question and the right answer. First thanks to the social medias and the globalization people tend to think that they can speak and write whatever they want to some people, especially to the known people. They argue that it's the freedom of speech but I'm convinced that celebrities have the right to the respect. When you are a celebrity, this is difficult to keep your life private but the other people have to respect your decision, if not, it's a kind of harassment. On the other hand, when you live in the public eye, the population has a eye of what you do and can make comment and judge you but in accordance to the respect I think. I'm totally against paparazzi who doesn't respect anything. To sum up, if there are rules for the privacy and if people understand the importance of respect, I think that there are no problem to manage both side of the celebrities. ",B2,0360.xml
"It is very difficult to determin which book is the best I have ever read because I have read many and many and I am still doing it. However, after a few minutes of thinking, I would say the Harry Potter books. First, they helped me love reading when I was a little girl. Indeed, my father ""almost"" ordered me to read at least one or two chapters everyday in order to improve my reading speed, my vocabulary and so on and so forth. When I finished the third one, I was completely in love with the books and it gave me the desire to pick up another one. Today, I have at least a hundred books at home. Second, they are my first saga so they are more precious to me than could be The Chronicles of Narnia or even The - So Precious- Lord of the Rings. Finally, we can not deny that JKR made an enormous work given that she created a world from A to Z: the characters, the places, some of the creatures, the spells, .... Her whole magic world has had a huge impact on our own one because we are using her specific vocabulary in the daily life. For instance, someone is saying to be a muggle when he or her is lacking particular skills. In conclusion, the Harry Potter books are definitely one of the best books I have ever read. ",B2,0566.xml

I don't believe in negative messages to generate positive actions. The problem is not in the way we treat environment, it's in the way we think it. We must think first about why we feel so separated from environment, then what we want to do with that relationship, and in the end what we want to change or to keep that way. ",B2,0599.xml

"Social networks : destroyer or potitif factor on relationships ? On one hand, I strongly believe that social networks can have a negative impact on relationships because it keeps away real link between people. I need to see my friends face to face to Internet can not remplace a genuine relation between friends. I do not trust in e-relation as it sounds fake. Social networks are not the real life, not natural, not spontaneous. On the other hand, social networks can be usefull to keep in touch with everyone you desire to linked to. Time flight and we do not always find the time to meet up with friends. Social networks are really usefull to have news, see pictures, talk to friends while you can not see them face to face. To conclude, I trust that social networks have either negative and positive impact on relationships.Using it with moderation and not as the only way to maintain or create a connection. ",B1,0386.xml
"Most people think that social networks are just alienating and addictive networks, that are bad for people because it reduces communication and interactions in the real life. However, in my opinion, there are still many benefits behind it. First of all, social networks promotes organisation. People can talk to an entire group in the same time, they can describe really precisely an event that they are organising, they can update data,... On social networks like Facebook, you can say ""I participate"" or ""I don't"" and this make it very easier for the person who organises the event. Second of all, social networks are really great for creating bonds between people that would never have existed otherwise. To exemplify that, imagine you are part of a football group on Facebook, you know that every member of the group (even the ones that you don't know yet) share your passion. Another example is the fact that people can take contact easily to professionals thanks to LinkedIn. However, I can't deny that social networks are sometimes dangerous. It might convey information that is not true. Some people might get hurt by what other people say. Some people might develop unhealthy relationships. And a lot of people might talk rubbish because they are hiding behind a screen. But to conclude, I would say that thanks to social networks, real and sincere relationships can be created, and strenghtenend. It's just the role of each of us to be careful and to stand back on what we hear and read. ",C1,0392.xml

"""Brassicole the 16th of March"" On the 16th and 17th of Marchn there was an event organised on the ULB campus, a university of Brussels. My friends asked me whether I wanted to join them to have some free time over there and to have a drink, I decided to meet them up right there even if I didn't want to spend so much money. As I'm working in a delivery restaurant, it occurs that some generous customers give us, me and my colleagues, some tips, so I wouldn't really spend my own money and I could, kind of, enjoy for free. I picked a friend up to reach the others in Brussels and I parked my car in the Franklin Roosevelt Avenue without paying attention where I was parked. We've had a great moment over there and I didn't drink so much as I had to drive to go back home. At 11pm, we were about to leave and some friends grabbed us to have a last drink before ending the night, therefore it was 11.30pm when we were on the way to the Franklin Roosevelt Avenue. We arrived on the place I was parked but I couldn't see my car anymore, I have been looking for it for a while without any result. So I called the number of the breakkdown service of Brussels and they told me my car wasn't parked at the right place and I had to go and pay a certain amount to get it back. I didn't know how I was going to go there to pick it up and how to get home firstly, the only thing I knew was that my tips wouldn't be enough to pay the tow truck which had towed away my car....

"I think that study abroad is a beautiful experience for some students. They learn a new langage, meet new people and discover a new culture. But for others, being far from what they know, from their friends and family, could be catastrophic. For example, there are host families who are totally unfriendly with foreigner students. In this case, the student coul feel very bad, sad and maybe he will isolate him/herself from the social world. Furthemore, some students could be ""alone"" and lost when they go abroad to study. It could lead to school/academic failure and to depression. So I don't think that study abroad should be a compulsory part of education. It depends too much on the student's personality and the situation within he/she will be. ",B2,0344.xml
"Some people argue that choosing the path to celebrity doesn't give you anymore the right to claim some privacy for youself. While I partly agree with that point of view, I tend to think every human being deserves the right to keep some decency and share only the things he or she wants. As written in our constitution, everyone should have the right to live his life privately. Nevertheless, some people have chosen to live in the public eye and share their private and most intimate moments with complete strangers. This is a choice they made as responsible adults and there is nothing wrong with it in my view. That being said, we have seen too many times these last years celebrities being exposed on the internet by hackers. These hackers have chosen to share private pictures of these celebrities without their consents and this is  something very wrong which proves once again how much our society has driften away from the value of respect we used to share. Being famous doesn't give you the right to disrespect others, so what right do we have to disrespect well-kwnown people? In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that each person living on this planet should have some basic rights, that includes a right to privacy. So I don't believe we should blame famous people for keeping some intimate moments to themselves. ",C1,0378.xml
"Nobody can deny that in our modern daily life, social networks play a major role. Their appearance have changed the way we communicate with each other on a lot of aspects. Altough most of the people say that it has a real positive impact on our relationships because we can communicate more easily, I don't really think this way and I will explain why. First of all, relationships through social media are not real relationships. Some key points of communication are missing, such as eye contact and non-verbal communication in overall. When you say a few sentences on Facebook and Twitter, they don't necessarily have the same meaning as when you pronounce them whith emphasis or emotions. Although I recognise that social media make it easier for us to meet new friends and to gather us, it doesn't replace real relationships. Furthermore, the person you pretend you are on your profile page is not your true self. On social media, you can filtrate all the informations about you and you can even lie and make up a new life. Consequently, you are never certain of the identity of the person you are speaking with and you can cheat your interlocutor. To sum up, you could have some big surprises when you meet your Facebook friends face to face. In one sentence, the social networks gather people and expand our friends circle but at the same time it replaces our relationships by fake ones. ",C1,0393.xml
"The right to privacy has never been as important as it is today. Wherever we look, this issue keeps making the front page of every newspaper. The progresses of technology makes it increasingly harder to guarantee it. Among those concerned by the issue, movie stars and VIP's. In this essay, it will be discussed about the right to privacy for those who live in the public eye. The right to privacy is principle that can be found in every democracy in the world. It is tightly bound to other principles such as freedom of speech, freedom of thaught, secrecy of the vote, etc. It garantees to every citizen the right to live the life he/she choosed to live, without having to face other people's opinions an judgements. That being said, the importance of this right can be easily understood. If the right to privacy is considered to be essential for every citizen, there is no reason to think that it could be denied to VIP's just  because their job involves a public part. Besides, fame isn't always a choice, but rather the consequence of a succesfull carreer in a certain area. For instance, a writer agrees to sell a book to a reader, but that doesn't mean he agrees to have every detail of his private life revealed. ",C1,0387.xml

"For a long time, people did not pay attention at what they were eating. As a consequence, the life expectancy used to be much lower than it is today. I believe that a balanced and diversified diet can actively contribute to a healthy life. Moreover, failing to do so can deteriorate the health at an increasing rythm. However, it is not the only factor of that importance that support that goal. First of all, all scientists agree with the fact that only a diversified diet bring all the essential nurtients that our body craves. On the contrary, a diet based on only two or three dishes - as we can think of the one of fast-food lovers - only bring the same nutrients without filling in for the rest of it. In that spirit, we can easily understand why is a balanced diet good for your health. If your body adequatly have all the nutritional elements that it needs to function perfectly, it will wear down much slower than it would have if it did not and you will feel in better shape. Nevertheless, we need to amend slightly the previous claim. Indeed, if the diversity and quality of the meals are important for the health, we do not have to loose of sight the fact that quantity is a big factor as well. We do not have to abuse of the good recipe. Instead, we must use it with wise and moderation. As far as its importance is concerned, I think that they are, unfortunately, more factors to take into account. Indeed, we cannot diminish the importance that sport, smoking habits or even calm and peace of mind for example have on our overall health and on our life expectancy. To sum it up, I would say that a balanced diet might be the starting point of a healthy life but it must be joined by other habits as well as avoiding the degrading ones such as smoking or drinking. ",B2,0391.xml
"I totally agree with that concept. In your life everything as to be balanced. Who said that a good burger was not a delicious thing when you're super hungry after a busy day? Who said you can't eat sweets, candies, ice creams, pastries when you just want to? All those things definitely aren't forbidden to eat, but people need to realize they have to do it with balance. Burger? Yes, but not everyday. Ice cream? Once a week maybe. Balance what your body needs or not. Take a little of the things that are ""not so good"", and thye won't affect your body that much. Just as the well-known ""diet food"", such as salads, fruits, veggies... They are good for your body of course, but not if you eat them in big quantities. Eating only fruits and vegetables just because you want a flat belly doesn't make sense: your body is not used and acclimated to eating one type of aliment. You should diverse what you eat. They key to a healthy life is eating everything, from junkfood to diet and light food; but eating a little bit of each of them. ",B2,0385.xml
"Some people argue that a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. I believe it's mostly true to say that, nevertheless I don't think the factors can be organised to least important to most important. First of all, it is very important to eat healthy, because your body needs different kind of nutrients that cannot be find in junk food. ""You are what you eat"", goes the saying. Secondly, it mainly depends on the quality of each factor. What do you call a balanced diet? Does it need to have vegetables and meat, is it opposed to fat and fast foods or does it need a bit of these? Then, factors tend to be correlated with one another. If you have a healthy diet, it's probably because you care about your well-being, than you probably work out and sleep correctly. If these factors are correlated it's hard to say whether one or the other is more important. To conclude, a balanced diet is something subjective, some people may think eating junk food once a week may be fine while others find it way too much. How to measure what impacts your health the most, if all the factors are correlated, it's a tough question and very subjective in my opinion. ",C1,0408.xml

"I think the better advice I have to give is ""Be healthy"". Why, because if you stop drinking or eating chimical food, you'll make our environment safer. For example, if you stop to drink soda, the companys will product less plastic which, part of it, finally stays in the oceans and kills fishes and the others. That safes not only our nature but people who can't drink a healthy water because of it too, like some countries in Asia (India,...).Some people in Brazil have to replace theirs habits (to drink water) by buying Coca-Cola because it's less expensif. You can not only change your life but theirs too with doing only this easy thing. ",B1,0347.xml

"Over the last few years, there has been growing concern about environmental issues. The challenges we are now facing offer unprecedented opportunities to move towards sustainable development. The easiest way to lower our ecological footprint is the selective sorting of waste. This doesn't take more time than using a general dustbin while it permits a more optimal recycling. On the other hand, as students in Belgium, we have access to intensive public transportation. Moreover, this user-friendly environment is cheaper than using your own car and contributes to global CO2 reduction. For those who do not need to travel on large distances, it is even better to use the bicylce or go by walk. There are many options to try promoting respectful development and take care of our planet in order to preserve it for the next generations. ",B2,0353.xml

So now, the people are not in the real time. Then, Socail networks can combat lonelines. but do we really need 200, 500 or 5.000 friends?  For friendship, this is more than a face on a computer. Bullying is a negative aspect of socail networks. Mallicious people use it to harnass workers, colleagues or class counterparts.Young and old write insultin or hateful messages. But also, each social network has the potential to multiply relationship, delvolp new ones and some find love there. To conclude, social networks have positive and negative points on relationship.

"Both are important in some points of view. An enjoyable job is essential to have a good mood and to motivate you to work everyday at your workstation. Because a monotonous and repetitive job which you dislike may influence your mind and you may suffer from depression. As the sentence says : ""Money doesn't make happiness, but it contributes"". It is also necessary to earn a decent salary in order to not live in insecurity. It allows you to pay the rent or the loads, to buy primary needs and other stuffs. Of course, it depends on your situation. But most of the time, I would say that the money is the first choice due to the nowaday consumerism society. ",B2,0592.xml

Instead of meeting people of your town, some people keep playing on your computer. They miss a big part of their life. The real life is much more important than the virtual one. True relationships only happen in teh real life, when you can see and feel the other person and create a real link. In my opignion, the Internet has bring us a lot of advantages but we should not forget the true life goals.

"It's sure that having a healthy diet helps to have a healthy life. But for me it's not the most important factor. The way of life is the most important factor. Don't smoking and don't drinking for example are some factors whose help to be healthy. Sport is also very important. I think that you can eat what you want if you practice often sport. Giving a big importance to eating is not the solution. For me, everything is in the head. If you decide to have a healthy life, you have to practice a lot of sports and pay attention to every excess that you can make. Of course if you go very often to the fast food you won't have a healthy life but you have to find a kind of golden mean. As I said it's not the most important factor but it's still a factor. So my point of view is that sport is the most important factor for a healthy life and a balanced diet shouldn't have a lot of importance if you don't fall in the excess. ",B1,0380.xml

"N.B. I did not know the word ""compulsory"" and I needed to check the translation :) Yes, I think that it would be very interesting for each kid and teenager to study abroad at some moments of his scolarity. In general and especially in Belgium, be opened to different languages is really important. Belgium is a trilingual country. But a lot of belgian people are not familiar with the three languages. ""False immersion"" in a school based in its own village or its own city is quite artificial. And until studying abroad is not compulsory, it would be a kind of leisure for some students. So I think that real scholar programmes with immersion already in other regions inside the country and also outside the country would be very profitable for everybody. Be opened to foreign languages, other cultures, other mentalities, other uses, other environments is an important part of education, a way to grow up and to understand the world. But there is of course a lot of questions. Which budget for the State, which organisation for the school and for the families, ...? Complicated to create that! ",B2,0633.xml

"The most important factor of a healthy life When confronted to the question of how to lead a healthier life, it is imperative to talk about the diet we choose to impose on our bodies, and the effects we seek to obtain through it. A healthy life is acquired through a series of disciplined habits, eating healthy is only one of those. it would be interesting to ask ourselves what aspect of our health we wish to improve. Whether it is our weight, our cholesterol, our body's acceptance of certain vitamins, the way we eat plays an important role. However, for this purpose, eating a balanced diet must usually be combined with a healthy exercise routine. While exercising, an important amount of toxins is eliminated and our metabolism is accelerated. Thus, it is safe to conclude, that eating a balanced diet is essential to leading a healthier life, but it will achieve better results if accompanied by a daily exercise routine. ",B2,0418.xml

"According to more and more people, eating a balanced diet is one of the most factor for a healthy life. From my point vieuw, I totally agree with this. Healthy is definitely one of the most important thing that has importance for people and they actually care more and more about it. Being healthy depends on a lot of things and also things that we are not able to control, I mean some diseases are not forecastable. But there are also other things that we are able to manage and that can have a huge impact on our health. For example a balanced diet, I'm pretty sure that a balanced diet can play a huge role in our health. By eating balanced meals every day I'm sure that we can improve some factors related to health care, for example lifetime. But having balanced meals shouldn't be the only thing that we have to take care about. If you want to be really healthy you also have to participate to some kind of activities like sport. Other factors could also have a huge impact, like relationship. Being well in mind could have a huge impact on health. ",B1,0356.xml

"In my opinion, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram have a big impact on relationships. Because you always have to be careful of what you post in the public sphere. Pictures or even words can produce real troubles and can cause public disruptcies on the social life of the person who has posted them on the internet. Those social networks can also make trouble within families, because of a uncareful word in a commentary or in a conservation, families can be separated. Social networks have change the meaning of relationships and there is no turn around on that turf. If you're active on a social network, you'll always have to be careful of what you say because it is hard to repair something on the internet, it is not the same if you have the person in front of you and you can tell or what you mean.

"There is a belief according which a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. Personally, I do not think it is THE most important factor for for a healthy life, but it appears to me that it is a key factor. Firstly, I think that healthy diet is paramount for life hygiene because you it keeps you fit and provides you the right amount of energy for your daily activities. It prevents your body from nutritional shortage and from feeling drained. Also, considering the fact that it includes eating biological food without loads of pesticides and preservative chemicals, it has also a great impact to eat healthy to avoid such harmful products. It is not anymore necessary to prove that they weaken the human body and can cause cancers or other serious illnesses, although the European legislation sometimes does not prohibit them because they make deals with chemical corporations. However, I am convinced that a balanced diet alone is not enough to guarantee a healthy life. I do believe that a physical training is also essential. According to me, these two elements have to be gathered to pretend to a healthy life, but not only one of them. For example, if you eat in a balanced way but you never do any physical exercise, of the opposite ; if you do a lot a sport but you eat fatty dishes at every meal of the day, you will not have a good life hygiene. As a conclusion, I would rather say that BOTH healthy food and regular physical exercise combined are needed to have a healthy life. They are both paramount but that is why I would not claim with certitude that balanced diet is THE most important factor for such thing. ",C1,0383.xml

"In my opinion, it should be a part of education, since it's a great experience for a student, especially those who aren't able to go abroad, mostly due to financial reasons. It is important to travel around the world, to be able to see all the different cultures, to understand that we all have different lifestyles and that we have to learn new things from others. How are we supposed to learn if we don't move and see different things ? We need to be confronted with other people, different ones, with their own point of view, so that we can increase our knowledge. Traveling is a wonderful experience that can help us to become more responsible for our self and for the world in general, we don't only learn new things about other cultures and their livings, but we also learn who we truly are and what we want for the future.

"I tend to think that people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy to a certain extent. In fact, this is their choice to show them as celebrities. Consequently they choose to show a part of their life to the public. As a result, they must not be surprised to be followed by paparazzis who always want to have a good scoop about them. But there are limits on this  celebrity. In fact, everybody has the right to privacy when they want to keep something secret. We can't expose the whole life of somebody without his agreement, only to make money. This is why a part of their life must be private and nobody should negociate whit that. That is a simple rule of respect to the privacy of someone. Seeing as these people choose to be shown to the world, they choose to expose a part of their life. But them and the public must be nice to each other and respect each privacy life. ",B2,0368.xml

"It seems to be rather obvious that social networks have become a key aspect of today's society, specially among millenials. Teenagers all over the world have started sharing their personal live's on these internet spaces at a suprisingly rapid pace, something that has proven itself to be a dramatic change on the way they interact with each other. However, what could this possibly imply? An increasing attachment to electronic devices and the need to instantly show your internet network the latest news could result in fewer real life interactions with the people around them. Relationships are all of a sudden no longer based on trust or mutual interests, but rather on who's got the most ""online friends"" or ""followers""; It is all about demonstrating how good your life is in order to make other people envy you or be miserable, since they feel they could never have the same amazing experiences. Despite these worrying aspects, social networks are also a way of giving social introverts a way to reach out to people, proving themselves as useful tools, not only for them but also for people who would have never met otherwise.

"Nowadays, the internet is a part of our daily life. But it doesn't mean that it has only advantages. Knowing lots of people doesn't mean you are close to them. On the social networks we can have niew friends with one click and it is easy to meet the all world. We can keep in touch with people that are on the other side of the world. But we are hiding behind a screen and we can lie about our real personality and who we really are. Social networks can lead to an isolated behaviour because in real life we can't lie about who we really are and it is harder for some people to tell the thruth. Social networks can also have benefits for shy or busy people if they are afraid of meeting people or if they don't have the time to. It gives you the opportunity to meet other people than your colleagues or your family. I think that knowing too many people doesn't mean you are close to them.

"I think that social networks are a usefull and powerfull tool from our century. They kind of change the way that people communicate with each other. Sometimes for the best but sometimes, unfortunately, for the worst. Nowadays there's nothing easier than staying in touch with people thanks to social networks. Just a few clicks and a little typing and you can say hello to your friends and make them remember that you don't forget them (even if they live in another country and you can't see them very often). You could also text them but social networks are free and now, seriously, who doens't have a smartphone ? With social networks you can also find back people you were with in high school and see what's going on with their lives. It's easy, cheap and it doesn't take a lot of time. Because, everybody knows that the lack of time is a commmon syndrom from our society... Even if social networks can improve relationships and make them last, they unfortunately also have the power to destroy them. How ? Words. When you're hidden behind a screen, it's easier to say things that you would never say in real life. People sometimes forget that they're actually talking to other real people because they don't see their face and their reactions. Who has never read some mean and disrespectful comments on Facebook ? In 2016, we can say that social networks take a big place in our daily life. People are ultra connected between them all the time. That's why we can affirm that social networks have a big influence on relationships. I think that that influence's going to change again for the years to come because the actual trend's never going to stop to evolve. Anyway respect is the key to keep nice and positive relationships.

"Privacy is a big issue for everyone nowadays but famous people certrainly have it the roughest due to the fact that they have many fans who want to keep up with their idols. However privacy is something everyone should have a right to, famous or not. It can be both taxing and frustrating for a person to be in the spot light day in and day out, expecially when it comes to pop stars for example. Having to work hard to please the fans and fight for a moment of privacy and relaxation while being hunted down by the paparazzi can be tiring and can sometimes even lead to the artist in question succumbing to depression and turning to drugs. Some time ago a famous Youtube-based entertainer had his cell phone number leaked to the public which resulted in him ceaselessly receiving calls from fans, ending with him having to change his number. The attention that overly obsessed fans pay to stars can sometimes turn into harassment and can have negative effects on their health. The well-being of a person should always be placed first. No matter who you are, you're entitled to your privacy! ",C2,0695.xml
"According to my experiences I would say that having an enjoyable job is really more important that having a boring one with a high salary. It makes more sense to work for a company and projects that fit with our values and to evolve in a friendly environment. But, obviously, the salary we get must cover the expenses related to our livelihood. Probably the best option would be to find a job that we like, that is well payed and contributes to improve the society (in terms of sustainable development for example). I believe that is still a relevant challenge that a lot of people try to solve in our developed countries. ",B2,0657.xml
"In my opinion, the first item is more important for various reasons. The only important thing in this world, for me, is to be happy and the best way to get happiness is to do good around us. In this sense, as we spend a lot of our time at work, it seems important to me to have a job where you can realize things that can help people, in one way or another, regardless of the money you get. For me, that's the true meaning of an 'enjoyable job'. Moreover, I think that money, even necessary in our world, could be a source of a lot of suffering (interpersonal conflicts, disproportionate desire, psychological stress, divorce,...) while an enjoyable work could rather be, in one's daily life, a source of social and personal blooming.

"Let's first see what privacy still means nowadays, knowing that most people have a mobile phone linked to an e-mail address, have private and professional accounts on social media websites, manage their bank accounts online, as well as their travels and all kinds of other purchases. They probably save all their pictures and films on their laptop, communicate through social medias or relevant apps. Not to say all of this information might be saved in the 'cloud'. Believing that all this very personal information remains private would be rather naive, I guess. We know that it is being sold and used for commercial and marketing purposes - ""If you're not paying for the product, you are the product'. And although all of the above is normally done in full knowledge of the facts, it remains a very personal decision/choice, which is also a right, that should be somehow protected, as many of us are de facto living in the public eye.

But I tend that it mustn't be compulsory. Most of the people needn't to learn foreign language for their future job. Furthermore, I would argue that any people don't want to leave their friend, their family and their university to study in a foreign country. It's also possible that the study level is better in their country than abroad, therefore it isn't interesting to leave. Taking everything into consideration, i don't say that studying abroad is harmful.

"First of all, I'll just say that every little things are important. There are not ""little initiatives"". Let take the example of Louvain-La-Neuve, if every students try to sort the waste or take the train, it means that nearly 30 000 persons (whithout all the personals) are taking care of the environment. So, the first advice I can give is to see the big picture and don't think that your personal initiative are useless because we are thousands to do the same. Secondly, people could try to buy local products. It is difficult because we never know from where procucts come, that's why we need to create some labels for our local products (it will avoid a lot of pollution if we reduce the freight of some products). Finally, we could eat less fish and meat, for example we can try to eat veggie the week-end because we have much time to cook. The change could come from entreprises and governments because they can take important decisions about pollution and so on but first we have to show that we care about environment by doing ""our little initiatives"".

"Humans, like all the other animals, need to eat to live. Indeed, nutriment intake is the main source of energy for our bodies and therefore one of the most important aspect of our health. In fact, one can live without exercices, one can live without sun (albeit indirectly humans need sunlight), or one can even live without social life or intellectual activity. Science shows us that to fulfill our bodily needs, we need certain amounts of nutrients; vitamins, cereals, amino acids, fats and minerals among others. It is even more the case for certain category of people, namely sportives, physically active adults, children, teenagers, pregnant women and to a different extent elderly people. A balanced diet is therefore very important for an optimal health. Too much fat, and it can highly increase the risk of several illness, such as cancers or obesity. Not enough fats on the other hand will cause problems to the nervous system. Amino acids are needed for our body to create proteins, which will then be used to fuel our muscular tissues. Exemple are numerous, but how do nowadays sedentary humans cope with these needs? A lot of sendentary societies find themselves with several health problems due to several factors of our modern post-industrial society. Dietary wise, there are many factors but let's talk about one of the main one: overconsumption of animal-based nutrients. The modernization of our agricultural method has made production of meat and dairy products much easier and has made the price of these products much cheaper in many developped countries. Despite of the efforts of the agro-industrial lobbies, most animal products have shown to be harmfull for the human physiology, especially when consummed in big quantities, which is the case is many countries, like China, USA and EU countries to name a few. Most meats and fishes provide us with significant and unnecessary amount of bad cholesterol for instance, or when consumming more than a few hundred grams of meat per week, give us amount of proteins exceeding highly our needs. But in meat consumption, red meat is definitly the most dangerous product and has been classified recently as a cancerogenous product by health authorities. Red meat intake increase the risks of heart problems or digestive systems failures and cancers. To go on the positive side, societies with little animal products consumption show signs of better health and longer lives, as it can be seen in some part of China or India where meat consumption is rare. Vegetarian and vegan diets have also shown their proves for physically actives and non actives people as a very suitable dietary option. Recently, the ADA (American Dietary Association) has shown vegetarianism and veganism as very possible diets for a healthier life. If one decide to carry on eating meat on a regular basis, several health specialists recommend eating meat up to 3 times a week maximum, with amounts of meat or fishs in these meals not being higher then 100g. Researchs show that leguminous plants such as beans, peas and soy would be much more efficients source of amino acids, if mixed properly with adapted grains (such as rice with lentils, wheat with peas, etc.). These news are now wide spread amongst developped countries and we can assume that in the next few decades, it will be harder for the agro-industrial lobbies to make their propaganda so succesfull. {initial}. {name} ",C1,0696.xml
"Each day we can hear stronger the sentence ""We are what we eat"". We keep on seeing on the news how in developed countries there are higher percentages of obese children. Usually, we can see those kids eating a hamburger-fries-soda menu of any well-know food chain. Is it what we want for our present and future? As I can see it, I agree completely with the statement proposed: eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. It doesn't mean that it is not allowed to eat a menu as the above described, but not everyday nor everyweek! When we eat a balanced diet we give our organism all the vitamins, antioxidants, essential oils, ions,... that it needs without necessity of supplementary pills to improve our intake. We will have all the energy needed as long as we have proteins, fat, carbohydrates and vegetables everyday. We will feel full of power and ready to deal with whichever our aims are! Unfortunately, some people is afraid of eating fat and/or carbohydrates as part of their diet because they think they will put on weight. It is necessary for our organism to get what it needs in the simplest way and avoid it unnecessary efforts to get it. As a result, our body will only get undesirable secondary products that could even end poissoning it. So, as long as we fancy a balanced diet and combine it with some exercise, we will be ready for the healthiest way of life. ",B2,0682.xml
"Social Media are made to bring people closer. MySpace, MSN Messenger at the time, Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp today were all designed to share your daily life and passions with your friends, fictional or not. But fifteen years after the upcoming of these networks, one has to admit: these actually brought us appart. In a couple, rare are those who don't go to sleep with their smartphone, while their loved ones are lying down next to them, doing the same routine. Checking facebook, browsing on Twitter, liking on Instagram (Google+ is just irrelevant). Those ritual moves are killing daily relationships and give the false impression to be closer of your so-called friends.So here is my opinion: social networks are the new opium of the people, as they tear people appart while giving the impression to be closer of fake, unreliable friends. People should care about their direct circle, spouse/husband, kids, friends, enjoying little moments for themselves instead of thinking of a good filter to pimp up their photographs. In a couple of month, I'll be leaving Belgium for the other end of the planet. Literally. And for quite a while. Since I announced my trip to my family, good friends and colleagues, I came to realize that the time I spend with them is a thousand time more precious than the lost minutes I spent on Social Media.

When I like a person, I always want to talk with that person (logical) and social networks like Facebook make tat so easy because it's totally free and you can chat super easily on lots of devices. You can also share pictures or anything you want so people ave news from you(even if they don't contact you) and that's different from before.

"In my opinion, this statement is basically true. It has been shown by several studies that malnutrition and/or one-sided nutrition is not healthy in the long run and also affects mood, motivation and wellbeeing in general. We all know that we do not feel particularly good when we eat nothing but fast-food for a week or have just devoured a complete chocolate cake. However, being obsessed about your diet, constantly thinking about it and restricting yourself too much is not healthy either. For me a healthy balanced diet means also that I can eat what I crave for. Usually, the body knows best what he wants. If you are thirsty, you drink water. If you need salt, you want to eat salty food etc. Of course, we can also not completely give in to our cravings, but it is important to find a healthy balance to achieve a healthy life-style.

"Dear reader, let me share with you a little of what I gain by being schooled at Liège city. Any level of expectation is subject to a scale. In my understanding, unit of measurements have been made and are maintained by humans. In other words, talking about eating a balanced diet as the most important factor for a healthy life, remains what humankind has always been trying to do : compare itself to its ability to tailor its own scale, which should be the best if the wiĺlingness of continious positive improvement exist. The real question is : who is scaling the initial scale in order to keep as long as possible the power of the scale ownership factor  ? ..  Health is like the factor  which has to be closely monitored. Without being healthy any human lost their mind. So to be a good scaler one should absolutely be as healthy as possible. What if life is not understandable at the highest state of consciouness, who will be able to judge weather choices are what is called balanced ? History shows that any species alive deserves what is best for them but jealousness as failed in giving what any species really deserves. Free choices as well as imposed ones are not anymore at stake.

I would like to visit some country and cities like New York, the Africa. My boyfriend want to go to Cuba. So maybe we will travel more than now. ",B1,0532.xml
"I have just seen Batman vs Superman and I couldn't miss the occasion to share with you my opinion. I won't speak about all the aspects of the movie (I mean the plot, the actors or the music) because I would be too long to explain and you can easily find that on the internet. I just want to share something like verdict with you. Here is mine : it was good ! Whatever you could hear on the social networks or in the newspapers just remember this famous quote ""don't judge a book by it's cover"". I couldn't be more true. The fact that I like this blockbuster and superheroes movies may sounds strange for most of you but I find in this kind of stories something similar with greek mythology.. You will also notice some obvious references to Greece and also some potential philosophy subjects. You should definitely go there and see the movie, I hope you will enjoy it as much as me.

"At the moment, there are a lot of student who want to study abroad in their last year of education. Their main reason is to improve their level of a foreign language. For this same reason, I think that study abroad be a compulsory part of education. In deed, with it, students improve very fast a foreign language. It is more efficient that learn the language by themselve because they are using it in the real life with people who just speak in the foreign language and so it's faster and easier to learn the language. However, I'm not really sure that study abroad be a compulsory part of education for each student. In deed, some study don't need to be accompagned with a foreign language. The natal language could be only necessary. This is the case for example for the psychology, medicine, etc.. Also, I think that if study abroad is an obligation, students will not live it like a reward but more like a punishment. They will not be happy to improve their language and so that could be a very bad experience. Finally, study abroad be a complusory part of education for the main part of education but it would not be an obligation. I think it's necessary to keep it as a reward for students that want to improve a language. ",B1,0334.xml

"I don't totally agree with this sentence. Of course, to have a healthy life you need to look after what you eat but this isn't the main thing. You will also need to do some sport. I am not talking about going to the gym, walking or cycling instead of taking the car when possible is enough, as long as it is done more than once a week. Moreover, a healthy life depends on your sleep time. having a good a night sleep is important. Drinking plenty of water is a factor which will help you get a healthier life. Our body needs water to work properly. it will help remove waste and it will carry nutrients and oxygen as well. Avoiding alcohol and cutting smoking can also help. Those 2 things don't bring anything good to your body. You are likely to have cancer and liever disease. Smoking gives you bad breath and teeths problems. this might be a silly thing but from my point of view, think positive can also give you a healthier life. You will evacuate the stress which can cause sometimes health isssues. Finally, we come to a point to say that a healty life depends to many factors as important as each other. ",B2,0693.xml
"We need money to live. That's a fact. We need money to feed ourselves, to pay basics things like shoes, clothes, education... But do we need a lot of money? Personally, if I have enough to fulfill these basics needs and a few more such as having hobbies, I'm happy. Actually this is the real question : what do we need to be happy in life? The answer for me is more having friends, being self confident, being healthy... A way to achieve this goal, be happy in life, is to have an enjoyable job. We spend a huge amount of time at work so having a job that we like (maybe love?) is more than a first step to live better. It is necessary. ",B2,0650.xml
"Study abroad will allways be an interesting way to learn foreign langages, other peoples and ways of life.  Meanwhile, you can't oblige someone to be interested by those matters.  In such a case, it will be a loss of time and money.  I prefer someone, maybe with a limited ambition for his carreer, studying in his country because he will feel free, moving in his familial neighbourood, remaining in good conditions for his scolarity.  Leaving your cocoon, your family, your friends, your country to study abroad could be felt by a boy (or a girl) like jumping from a plane without a parachute!  It's not always the case.  Some students go away with friends.  Some others are so strongly motivated that they don't be afraid of that big jump! ",B1,0644.xml
"I think that eating a balanced is a central piece to maintain or reach a healthy lifestyle. It means that you can eat of everything, but in an appropriate amount compared to dietetic rules and food pyramid. If you exclude a category of nutriments or if you follow a monodiet regimen, it will have a worse impact on your body than doing nothing. Every category of nutriment is important: protein to construct the muscles, lipids to repair the cells, carbohydrats to give strenght and energy, but most of all water for life! Nevertheless, I've heard that without physical exercice, healthy diet is less effective. Combined with it, it can for instance revert type 2 diabetes symptoms, diminish the risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduce arthritis disorders. Healthy lifestyle is something global, it includes the diet, but also the physical exercice, the quality of sleep, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, emotional management, adaptation skills and social support.

"Money and enjoyable job, both are important. I need money to live and I also need to feel comfortable with my Job. Having not enought money is not comfortable because it means saving money.To have to much money is also not comfortable, because a lot of persons should be jealous and would like to have your money. Having an enjoyable job means to feel comfortable at work : you do wat you like with people you like. Having a boring job means to do things you don't like with people you don't like all the day and every day. I think it is more important to have an enjoyable job because you do what  you like with people you like so that working is a way to feel well. If you have a job witch pays verry well but is boring you might have friends who want your money and colleges you don't like. When should you open out ? Of course having a lot of money means to have the oportunity to do a lot of funny things. but doing funny things doesn't mean to open out. ",B1,0645.xml

"The best book I've ever read is the Harry Potter saga, which is composed by 7 books. I love reading this book because the writer talks of a new, magic world which a lot of character and also a lot of moral basis, like friendship, relationship, happiness and the fight between the good and the evil's character. I started reading these books when I was very young, around 11 years old, when the first book had been published. One years later J. K. Rowling, the writer, decided to transform her immaginatory's books into film's saga. And I started to go further with the books and the film together because I love finding another place from reality and improving my immagination, but also because everyone at that time was reading that. Ten year later I started to read all the books and I found totally a new book because I was around 19 years old, I totally understand the moral basis that I talked before and I really love them and I think that everyone should read the books.

"The issue of environment Currently, the environment is one of the biggest challenge in our society. Few consequences of human activites are affected the heatlh of the planet. With issue of global warming, there are some solutions we can bring. Firslty, humans need to change thier mentality about the environment. We have to be more closer of nature. It is mean, respect nature, environmental friendly. Indeed, the polution by humain beings is relevant issue. For instance, if person avoid to use their car very frequently it would be better for the atmosphere. Secondly, the industries is one of actors which could contribute to resolve of this issue. We are living in consumption society and the companies are main actors. Their supply chains or productions need to be improve for respect the environment. For instance, the companies need to share with others industries the innovation in sustainable ressources or practices. Thirdly, there is a straighforward solution against capitalism. The capitalism and the economy in worldwide seems to be unefficient. This situation are caused many problems. Maybe, we need to change the entire mentality. It is mean, think about other way of living. For instance, this solution would mean stop mechanism of capitalism and the current economy.

It was the first time that I went in this city and it was really a beautiful trip.  Firstly, the weather was very good. Every day was sunny and the sky was blu. The landshappes were wonderful because of the high mountains and the beautiful lake that passed through the village. Secondly, I have meet the family of my grand-father for the first time. His sisters and brothers and also his nieces. The life there is poor but people live with the necessary, there are simple and they are rich in what they have learnt in their life. Moreover, I have seen the house in which my grand-father was born and has growth. Now, they have built an italian restaurant in this place..the things are changing...herbs are replaced into cement..clams are changed into buildings...the worlds is falling down...  The day after, We went to the cimetery to pray for the ones that aren't there yet. The last day, we visted the center of Bergamo. In the old part of the city, there are a lot of old museums, churches, typical bakeries and restaurants. In the modern part of the town, there are especially many shops and bars.

"In my opinion every have a right to have a private life. Doing a job, that puts us in the public eye should not prevent us keeping a part of our life secret for the others. It is not because we are famous that everybody has to know everything about us. Nevertheless those people accept somehow to have privacy as the jobs they are doing get them to be known by a lot of people. Morever nowadays it is getting harder to know where is the line between private and public life. Indeed, with all the social networks even the ones who are nor living in the public eye have less and less privacy. You can see on Instagram or Facebook, what people eat, wear, buy and so on.I am personally not very into social network because I don't think that everybody doesn't have to know what I am doing with who. In conclusion people who live in the public eye have a right to have privacy because everybody needs it. However they have to aware that if they live in the public eye, the line between private and public life will change and it will be harder to keep things unknown by people. ",B2,0684.xml

For exemple, you can take the public transportation instead of your personal cars every times it's possible. you can also buy things with the less packaging posssible. Avoid food waste, it's better to prepare less to eat and if at the end of the meal you are always hungry, you can even eat a fruit or dessert. It's also good to switch off all your eletric devices when you do not use them. Real switch off, not only putting them in  ""power saving mode"".

Improving the recycling of every kind of waste (already produced) would be all benefit, for the Nature and also would provide new kind of employment, and at the current state of the world economy, that could also help... Globaly, improve the educationnal system, creating them where they do not exist, where they have disapeared and improve those that need it. We have to realize that our ressources aren't unlimited!

You can even take the cycle for the littles journeys. Secondly, we have differents ways to improve the environment at our homes and in the differents tasks like have a shower, go to the toilet,.. For example, if you brush your teeth or when you clean yourselfe with bath soap, don't let de water flow. Or in winter, if you have a little cold, don't rise the radiator but take a big pullover and wear it. Third, we can use more green-energies, if we have the financials possibilities to invest in solar panel or little wind turbine I think this is a really important way to improve the environment.

Even if a student can afford it, he shouldn't be obliged to study abroad, to leave his family behind and to let go some opportunities. So the choice of whether or not study abroad should remain. At last, a lot of students have obligations in their countries and leave them could be damageable.
