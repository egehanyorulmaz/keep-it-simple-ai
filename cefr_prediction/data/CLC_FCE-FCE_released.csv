"Dear Ms Jane Clark, Recently I visited an arts festival, organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation it is great. However, I have some proposals about for its improving improvement next year. At first First, I propose suggest you to invite invite stars and artists not from all over the world, but from only six countries. This change will give the opportunity to create some different performance. The second my my second My second proposition is about the classic classical concerts. I suppose think that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about it in advance. This year I noticed that there were only a few plays and films. From my point of view, there should be more films because this part of the festival is interesting for people. And, at last finally, I should congratulate you with on the decision of making to make to have one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is convinient convenient both for the people public and the organisators organisers. I hope you will consider my proposals. I am looking forward for to this the festival next year. Yours faithfully sincerely,",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ana, Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice. The things you wrote about in your letter are quite common familiar for me, because we, actually at the moment, have some problems about with our rules. At first First, about school. I'm really fed up with our school forne uniform ! It is awfull awful ! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. Off Of course, if we had such a pretty forne uniform like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment. What should I say to you about home... We are quite a friendly family, that's why we actually don't have some any special rules. However, we promised our perents parents to make do some cleaning up every week. This is all I wanted to write to you about rules. I miss you very much. I'm looking forward to see seeing you next summer after my exams. Write to me what do you think about it. Kisses to your family,",2.3,0102_2000_12
"16.12.00 Dear Jane Firstly, I want to tell you that the idea of the ""International Arts Festival"" was a really great idea. I enjoyed the festival pretty much. However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange little small details. I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival. This also would take more attraction to the festival. Another point which I think was ennoying annoying, are is was the concert halls hall. The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so much many people. I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall. The plays and the films were really great. I enjoyed all of them. I hope to see much many more films next year. The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it made had a really big effect on the attraction, and that of course made the festival much more enjoyable. I again want to say that it was really nice to be at the festival. I believe that next year will be better if you consider my ideas. Your Yours Sinccerly Sincerely sincerely",4.3,0102_2000_12
"16.12.00 Dear Andrew, I just received your letter and decided you to write back now ; because of your questions which were about the rules. I'm really tired of the rules in school! Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly unfortunately the school that I'm going to is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearing wear has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict, however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example, if you don't come to school for 10 days in a year, we you fail that year. Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing everything except smoking and drinking alchol alcohol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to play music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to. This is all that I can tell you about my school and family. Rules are every where everywhere and you can't change them. So just don't think about them. Your Best best Pen pen friend",4.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane, I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea. I would like to tell give you some suggestions. The stars and artist artists are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls. I think you should put it that in the advertisement. Are there going to be more plays and films next year? I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there is are a lot of people who went go to see only one or two events, and by paying for the all events all-events ticket, they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expected expect to find interesting. I would like you to answer my letter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you,",3.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear John, Here in Brazil the rules at school depends depend on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder stricter than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use wear the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams. the The rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie study enough to aprove. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they They know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways always easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them. I am looking forward to hearing from you,",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dec. 16th, 2000 Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory. First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it. Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition audience. They were cold and moist damp, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficient inadequate. Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all the events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided. Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year. Yours sincerely,",5.3,0102_2000_12
"Dec 16th, 2000 Dear Mary, I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here. Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person person plural (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected. Another thing that is different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period. Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' our parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m. I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still ones some coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules. Take care!",5.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark, the organiser of the International Arts Festival I'm one of the citizen citizens people that enjoyed the last International Arts Festival. Most of the attractions are were excellent, but I'd like to point out that the "" quality is was high, but the quantity is was not enough !. First of all, the only ""six countries"" doesn't mean ""around the world"". I suppose you had difficulty to manage managing the schedule. Second, some concert hall halls were too small, so some of the audience couldn't concentrate on to listen listening to the music. And others couldn't enter the hall. But the "" All in one all-in-one ticket"" was a good idea. In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is a wasting waste of time. I pressume presume if the term becomes longer the festival become will become more excellent excellent better. Because, because it's it'll be easy easier to manage the artist artists artists' schedule and the audience can enjoy the live. I'd like to go to the Festival again!",2.3,0102_2000_12
"Thank you for your letter. And I'd like to answer for your question. AT first First, in Japan, generally school rules are more strictly strict than at home's home. The gap between them is tremendously big! I can say the action actions which is are prohibitted prohibited at school is are no problem at home. Because, because the purpose of school rules is not only to create discipline but also unify unity. Here, I write will write down one of the rules at my school. ""Whenever the students wear an extra item of cloth clothing (because of the cold or something) his or her (not the students student !) parents write down fill in an application form with their authorized signatures"". You will ask me why, the. The reason is the given above..."" unify unity "". In addition ""the students must not use any commercial paper bags ( received at a department store etc)"". Now you know the reason! Needless to say I'd like to change such ridiculous rules, because such rules are not for us. They are for teachers ' ! Don't you think so? Do you have any rules at school that make you upset? If you have please tell me. Yours faithfully",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jean Clark, I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it. Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce announced said in your advertisement. Secondly, I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken took place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed shown were interesting,. In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy buying only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them. I look forward to hearing from you. Your Yours sincerely",3.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear George, Sorry it's been too long since I last wrote but I've been so busy at school that I couldn't answer you before. As you tell told me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you want wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First, I must tell you that the teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in at individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, because mum and dad are great but there's one main rule : I must tell them were where I go am going and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem because she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind kinds of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it take any notice of her. I really must get down to some homework now so I'll stop here. Give my love to your parents. Write to me soon",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mr Ms Jane Clark, My name is Rosa Santor. I'm 24 and I'm a student from Poland. I study architecture at the Polytechnics Polytechnic in Krakow. I'm very interested in art, specially especially in paintings and goings going to galleries. I'm writting writing you a letter, because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival. I recently spent two days at this festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion, if this is an international festival, it would should has have more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like it was this year. It was a great idea for doing to do something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hall concert halls were too small for all the people, who took a part at in attended that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also it a great idea was was a great idea, that it was to have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. I think, as a person, who in this festival took place part in attended attended this festival, that this it is was excellent, because we can could spend a lot of time with art. There is only one bad fhing thing, that this festival was too short. In my opinion, next year it should take place over much longer more than two days. I'm not looking foward forward expecting to received receive a letter from you, because I know, that you are busy, but please look at my suggestion for next year's festival. Yours sincerly sincerely,",3.3,0102_2000_12

"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you to give you some opinions of mine abut about The International Arts Festival. It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing, plus of getting acquiring some important knowledge from it. On the other hand there were some disadvantages: 1. Stars The stars and artists wee were only from from only six countries. 2. Some concert halls were too small. So it was impossible to get tickets there. 3. I think that there were not don't think that there were enough plays and films. To sum up I want to tell you bout about my suggestions for next year's festival. It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms programmes with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that the dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g. the national dancing dance of all the countries) to impress the audience and not to bore with the similar scenes. I hope this letter will help you in with organying organizing the festival. Yours faithfully sincerely",2.3T,0102_2000_12
"Hello Philip, I have just got your letter. It is a pleasure for me to communicate keep in touch with such a friend as you are. Thank you very much. In our school we have the following rules: 1. Every puple pupil has to sit alone. (I mean that one desk is given for to one man person. ) 2. One should have such marks as,,3"",,,4"",,,5"", not,,2"", which is eaqual equal to fail. 3. Another strict rule is not to be late for your lessons. Otherwise you are not allowed to come in. These rules are strict and certainly we have an endless number of just-so-called rules. I don't think you will be interested in them. Truely Truly Honestly speaking I am not sure about home rules. I think that in our family everything is based on mutual understanding. We don't have old-traditioned old-fashioned rules or something anything alike like that. I'm afraid I must be going now because I want to send you this letter today. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Clark, I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival.' First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year. To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in. In fact, their there were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries. Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to too small or in other words to too many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoid You could avoid this kind of problem when if you look for big halls at the begining beginning outset. Another point where you could improve is when if you show more plays and films next year. Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price. To finish this letter with, I would like to give you a good idea for next year. In my opinion it would be nice if you create created an exhibition place space where the guests can try to play different instruments. Yours sincerely",3.3,0102_2000_12
"How can you earn money in your spare time? I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people where who asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to too much work. A traditional way to earn money, in the your spare time, is to bring deliver newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems problem that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything get gets wet. Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for with changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to do doing some other small jobs. But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where that you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the begining beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at it you'll also earn some money. Okay don't wait, there where you're good at and begin.",4.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you to give some opinion opinions about the International Arts Festival that you have organized organized last November. First of all, I believe that it was very interesting, but there were few fewer artists than I have had expected. In fact, they came from six countries. I wonder if it is possible for next year to have more artists and also bigger concert halls. In fact I have noticed that some concert concerts need needed to more space. I would be grateful if, next year, you could put include more art exhibitions (with more pictures) in the program programme. I was very interested in the ticket of Festival festival ticket. It was not expensive and was easy to use, because it there was only one for all the events. I would offer you one suggestion that concers concerns the classical concerts. I think it would be interesting to invite young compositors composers to hear news new things from the classical music. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely.",2.3T,0102_2000_12
"Dear Magda, how are you? Well, I hope. I'm O.K. I've just received your letter and I'm going to reply to your questions. In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools. For example, we have to wear dress in an appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers. At this time, in my school there is a new rule. We aren't allowed to use the a mobile phone in class. Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster. And now about my home. I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time in at which my family can eat together. For me, it's very stressfull stressful and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like cheat with my class mates classmates after our lessons. I'd like to change a rule at home. I'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m. It's a boring rule. Neighbours have complained about loud music. Write to me soon about news in your life. Love",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mr. Clark, I'm a an italian Italian student who has come came went to the last International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea because it's a an possibility opportunity to see and to love appreciate the art, but, I think also also think there are some things thas that could be changed. I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted instead that from around the world. This choice doesn't give many artists the possibility opportunity to expresse express themself themselves. Some concert halls were too small and often people couldn't see the performances. There were many events that and I think there were a few plays and films. Maybe it would be better put to put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people young people like them so much. The very about young people, the choice decision to offer a reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket is a an excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art. I hope that my opinion can help you to set organize fro for the next year a great internation international arts festival alone to young people. Thank you and greetings.",3.1,0102_2000_12
"I think a good way to get money it's is work to work in a fast-food restaurant. Maybe the first impression isn't positive but, from my personal experience, I can say that this kind of job is right fine for get getting some money. For six months I've worked in a McDonald's restaurant in Italy and I've got lots of money. I worked eight hours every day, but in every fast-food restaurant you can work part-time, four, three, six hours every day. It depends on what you need. This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get to get money and in the meantime at the same time they have to study. If you work in a fast-food restaurant you can work in the afternoon, or during the night, and so you have time for yourself. In Among the staff you can also find young people and getting having have fun with them during the work. What do you want more more do you want ? If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that.",3.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival. Last season I spent two days at the Festival. I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better. First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can know get to know artists who cames comes come from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last edition there were the artists who cames came from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa. Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of for different kind kinds of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall concert halls were too small, and because of it that I couldn't see one of the concerts in on the programme. In my opinion, one of the best things of about the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there. I saw films and I played ping-pong. In At the next edition will there be more or less of that ? I hope more More I hope. The thing that I liked much more than others anything else, was that I had to buy only only had to buy one ticket for all the events, and it was no not pricey. It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you,. I think you should do have a baby-parking kindergarten, in. In fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sons children. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully sincerely",3.2,0102_2000_12
"I like read reading very much, because every book that I read shows me a different world. What I try am trying to explain is that in every book there are characters or situations that are really different. So we can read realistic stories or fantastic ones, it. It depends from on what we prefer. I always prefer read to read books that are inusual unusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity of escape to escape from the everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without doubts doubt, Wuthering Heights, a famous book written by Emily Brontë. The attention of the is focused on the unfortunate love of between Heatcliff and Catherine. They are the main characters of that book, and what caracterize characterize characterizes them is the violence of their passions. In this book you can find only good or bad characters, ; everything is good or bad. If you look at this book like a painting you can't see afumature of colours, you see only primary colours. In other words, when I read a book I want to go in into a world where I can find something different from my everyday life.",3.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mrs Clark, The discovery of the ôInternational Arts Festivalö was a pleasure for me because it gave me the opportunity to enjoy onto a really nice environment. The proposal of reasonably- piced priced package, including tickets and accomodations accommodation, well supported suited my personal organization situation : comfortable rooms that are easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute. As far as the Festival itself is concerned, some small improvements could let make it works work better. Different Having different kinds of music is a good idea but some of them need special features. Larger concert halls can allow people to better enjoy the quality of the performances. Also, the introduction of different cultural experiences is a good idea but six countries can't be really really be considered as world wide worldwide representative representative of the world. The aim to satisfy different interests should not let cause the quality decrease to decrease. Just a final note: why not have more plays and films for the next year? Thanks in advance for your attention. Regards",4.2,0102_2000_12

"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing this letter to give my opinion on the last International arts festival Arts Festival. Firstly, I found amazing the number of starts stars and artist artists who came to the festival the number of stars and artists who came to the festival amazing although they where were from only six countries around the world. The concerts and the dance show were incredable incredible, except for the classical concert that was in a halled hall to too small too small a hall. Secondly, the plays and films were very good well organized despide despite being the short low number numbers. I suggest you to do do organise a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new life style lifestyle and society, it that was totaly totally different from ours. The talks by writers were very tecnic technical but it they could be understood by all the people who were in at the festival. In conclusion, I am was impresed impressed on by all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price has been was excelent excellent because there wasn't any limit of hours time time limit. I hope that you organice organise this festival for all the following coming years.

The Band band ""Three Kings"" apresented presented a new stily style of music. I would like to notice that a the dance show was absolutelly absolutely marvelous marvellous. What's What a greit great idea to invite writers there ! I relly really liked to speak talk talking with them. From my point of view I can complain only on about a the small concert hall and the fact there were artist artists from only six countries. Nowadays many people are fond of classical music, but this concert was too small that's. That's why many people had to miss missed this classical concert. You wrote an advertisment advertisement saying that people from more than 15 deferent different countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists only from from only 6 countries. It was relly really a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy. The International Arts Festival was organised quite well. I would only recomended recommended recommend you to have have more artists and a the classical concert should be in a bigger hall than it was.",2.3,0102_2000_12

"Dear Mrs. Jane Clark, Recently I was at the annual international arts festival, that you organized. I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving a the possibility opportunity to know more about modern art. I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries. Unfortunately, only six countries were represented this year at the festival, but I hope that soon there would be will be much many more of them. I extremely really liked all the concerts, shows, and exhibitions, but why there weren't weren't there any photograph photographic exhibitions? I think, you should make have some next year. Then Also, I want to mark point out, that the concert halls were too small, that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts. Then Also, I want to say, that the plays and films were exellent excellent, but it there wasn't weren't enough of them for me. May be Maybe you should make have more next year ?. And at the end finally, my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea, because you don't have to stay wait in queues to buy a ticket for a show, you want to go to. Yours sincerely,",S,0102_2000_12
"Dear Lucia, I was very pleased to receive your letter. You asked, if there are some school rules in my country. As you know, I'm studying at the a private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes. I'll give you an example. In our Acadamy Academy we are not allowed to smoke. The fine for smoking on the Academy Academy's is territory premises is 100 dollars. So nobody smokes there. I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule. But some of my friends really would like to change it. You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home. Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't prohibit stop me to go going to the discoes discos or somewhere with my friends. The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day. I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life. Look I look forward to hearing from you,",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark Hello, I spent two days at your annual international arts festival. I was very impressed and I wish you could make the festival better next year. I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other country's countries' art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many country's countries' people. You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small so that the people can't couldn't even dance in at classical concerts. This years' 'plays and films' was too short. I was very disappointed about this, but the other shows were great. I felt very good about all these shows. In my opinion, the tickets for all events is a wonderful idea, because everybody has a chance to see everything and the people would think this is a great festival. What do you think about picking five people and give giving them tickets for 'Art Travel'? I think this is a good idea. Generally it was very good and I wish hope more people would will come next year. Yours Faithfully,",3.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back so soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same. First, In in school, we are not allowed to run. This is very important, because many accidents happen because of running. When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best at what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other student's students' study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some family families have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday. I think the main rule is when you can play computer games, because they love computer games. Tell me about English rules. I'm curious about it. Your best wishes from",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Miss, I am writing to suggest some idea ideas for the International Art Arts Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed thought of some points improvements which could make the festival better. First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only only from six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some of the concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for all the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing the dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday one-day ticket or a reasonable reasonably priced ticket for every event. That is everything I have noticed thought of about concerning the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it. Yours sincerely",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Sharyl, Thank you for your letter. I really enjoyed reading it. I'm very happy to know you're pretty well. Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the their skirt skirts by 5 cm under below their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother interfere with studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning! In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up. I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you! Take care. I'll write to you soon!

First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible of for this good idea. It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city We all know that our city lacks art festivals and cultural activities in general. And what a belter better thing way to solve this than to give the festival an international character. But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural. Secondly, there were some problems of accommodation accommodation problems in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among with most visitors of the weekend ticket of the weekend ticket with most visitors, due to its economical price and because of its comodity commodity ease in of use. Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, as like ska or ethnical ethnic world music. Yours faithfully sincerely,",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Who doesn't want to earn some money? The topic says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them. If you still don't have economical financial freedom independence from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you. One possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best what you can do best in a public place, and, then, ""sell"" it to the people. For example, you can do a dance folk folk dance, be do Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you your country a nice song from your country with some of your friends. You must be aware, anyway however, of the difficulty difficulties of with this kind these kinds of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on). But maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey,chocolate... Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso, : it's is enough with a bit of imagination a bit of imagination is enough. If you don't feel like doing any thing of this of this thing of these things, you have alternative solutions. If you like fishing, you can try to colaborate collaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you can achieve catch by yourself. Finally, if anything none of the above achieves a result, you can could prepare organise the classical parties in discos or work as a babysitter. It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money.",4.3,0102_2000_12

The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event. First, I would like to congratulate you for on the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be profitable useful for next year's Festival festival. The artists you brought were only from six different countries, so I think you should next time next time you should try to offer invite us people from more different nationalities, to make it more interesting than it is already. Moreover, I have been thinking about changing the location because, as you probably already know, some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go to go in. Finally, I just would would just like to recommend ask you not to give up showing movies, during the Festival festival because the crowds were amazed thrilled with that them, and keep on offering the current prices, one of the best deal deals for us, the spectators. If you would like to talk about my suggestions, please, do not hesitate to get in touch and let me know. Yours faithfully sincerely,",2.3T,0102_2000_12
"Independent Student Magazine Here is my article. There are many ways to earn money, specially especially in a big city, like the one where we are studing studying all year around. Some examples could be delivering pizzas or newspapers, working as a bartender throug through at the nights night, cleaning services, etc. I usually call these jobs non- cualified qualified unskilled positions. I think, as a consecuence consequence therefore, that there is no difficulty in finding a job for our spare time. What it really makes us, the students, upset, is to find finding the perfect job. To be more technically technical and specifically specific, we need a very flexible job, wich which gives us independence and allow allows us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period. Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us should would be a position related with to our carreer career degree. Next year I expect myself finishing to finish my studies in LAW. And by that time I will have already already have some experience, so that I will more easily be able to apply be able to apply more easily for a really good job.

"16 December 2000 Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an the excellent organisation of an the annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows. However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Besides Also, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones. As a matter of fact, I consider one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events to be brilliant as it offers a unique opportunity to pay for everything all together and be able to attend different events. I believe your festival to be a great event in our cultural life and I am convinced that it is a success. I look forward to coming to the festival again. Yours sincerely,",5.2,0102_2000_12
"Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë For a start To start with I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think. As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite regardless of the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and the people around us our own life and the people around us better. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastic fantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday's everyday routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world world's treasurehouse treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistable irresistible fascination. To draw the conclusion In conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastic fantastical stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves.",5.1,0102_2000_12

Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small offer ; I hope it will be larger the next time. But do not worry!

"I think there are some possibilities opportunities for earning money. I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils, for example, in maths or english English. There are also some schools which offer such a job. To teach Teaching pupils is not easy, of course. But I think that after some a few lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff. So it would will be easier for the teacher then ! It is also Also it is not a dirty work,. I mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people other people's toilets ! And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers, as you would if you are were working in a shop. To be a good teacher you especially need patient patience and good nerves! Not everybody has the ability to understand everything at once. And the money you get is not less. So, if you like to b be with people and help them and if you have the talent to explain things good well then it would be the best, if you offer offered your help to the people!",3.2,0102_2000_12
"16.12.00 Dear Clark, I am writing to in response to the international International Arsts Arts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you, that it was a great idea and a valuable activitie activity as a social event. However, it was a dissapointment disappointment, when I realised that not many countries were attending to the event. I could be fine if I had would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance :, the far east Far East, indonesia Indonesia etc. It wasn't complicated difficult to find the right hall to for the shows, I should would say it was very well organised. But one thing, I have to mention is that some of the concert halls was were too small and it they wasn't weren't comfortable as well either, as to and this fell spoiled the great atmosphere. On the other side On the other hand, I enjoyed to being on one of the people to see seeing the plays and films, the dance shows which was were brillantly brilliantly performed - and the art exbitions exhibitions. Listening to talks by the famous writers was a an opportunity which I couldn't missed miss. I would like to ask, if you could expend extend the plays and films more for next year?

Its It's It was a good idea to send them to me, because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films. What a pitty pity ! By the way, how is your new school? Did Do you like it more than the previous one? I must say that our school rules are quite different than to yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed miss a lesson, that could be cause a trouble problem for yourself you. I think it depends on the school. Privat Private schools have a more relaxed atmosphere that than the state school schools. They don't have strike strict rules and students can take extra lessons. On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours behaviour are is punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks homework or they are sending send you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at in any part of the schol school. I have a relaxed family and we are sharing share all the houseworks housework. My Father father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying tidy up! But in many Families families, women are doing do more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together. Anyway, it I think that's it for now. I hope to hearing hear from you soon. Lots of Love love",3.3,0102_2000_12

The Festival festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from from only six counties they could be invited really from all over the world. Furthermore, and for sure certainly it is not your fault, some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall, that which was often two too crowded. I hope next year plays and films will be more there will be more play and films and that the ticket will be reasonably-priced reasonably priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival.

Being very fond of films, I would have appreciate appreciated seeing more of them. For next year's edition festival, you could possibly add some foreign films, like the Chinese ones, which I most like like most.

I was there for two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world. Well, here are some of my opinion opinions and suggestions. First of all, I think there should be more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only from from only six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world. The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls which were to too small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.

You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either. At home, there are less fewer rules. My parents don't really like putting imposing rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back. But it existed has existed since I was very young. I would like to change the rule about not to speak speaking in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish, but I guess, to learn., we should speak English all the time.

"Dear Jane Clark, I had a wonderful time at the International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea in that it allows people to enjoy arts from around the world, but I also have some complaints. First of all, I got was disappointed when I found that there were no artists from Indonesia. There were stars and artists from only six countries. Secondly, the concert halls. The performances were great, but some halls were too small to accomodate accommodate so many all the people who there were were there that day. A crowded hall is not good when it comes to enjoy enjoying musics music. Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success. I liked the plays and films, and want to see more next year. The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy the arts without worrying about money. So all you need to improve things is are to have larger concert halls. I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held going on using more notice boards noticeboards. I have no doubt that you will succeed in with next year's festival. Sincerely Yours,",4.1,0102_2000_12
"I would like to recommend the job, of a home teacher tutor. It is a job that where you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house. The best advantage of this job is the payment pay. It is very good considering how less little time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home teachers tutors are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it that means they take lessons after school, not in a the daytime. So, in a the daytime, we can focus in on our studyings studies. It is not so easy for every student, though. Because, because teaching requires a lot of knowledge. You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, for because it is your responsibility to provide your student with the right information. As you see, teaching is a hard work in some respect respects. But I am enjoying it and getting a lot out of it.",3.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about an annual international arts festival with a good impression. I have spent two days on it which was exciting. However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it. The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is a great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from from only six countries apart from your advertisement. I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events. The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic classical music, which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for the audience, so a few people had to stand and watch the concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised. As well as that, I expect you plays and films are performed more. Even if the majority of my friends had a good time there I saw some people would anticipate it, because there were many people who were impressed in it. Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is a an excellent price because when I am tempt tempted to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand recommend it to other friends. That's how I am feeling about that. I expect you can will be organised even better even better organised next year. Yours sincerely",2.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear George, Thank you for your letter. I could be interested in your letter. But it is quite different rather than you. Becoming more strict gradually at home that at school is true as you said. Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get have extra lesson lessons or test tests. But most teachers consult with their parents, so it if they behave wrongly it is true that teachers call their parents. Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on the weekend they have to help parents to do some chores. But people would like to change the life style lifestyle in their house because there haven't been aren't convenient appliaces appliances in their house houses yet. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours",2.2,0102_2000_12

"Ideas to improve Improve the Festival Dear Jane Clark, I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I write I'm writing to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not. Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is International international. But in the advertisement it was written said that the artists were from all over the world and but I saw only six nationalities. Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent and but the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year. Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. It They attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that. Finally, the reasonably reasonable price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind kinds of people an can afford to buy it them. I also think that you should put have a Snack-Bar snack bar or a little restaurant so as that the people are not too hangry hungry and morever moreover you can realise big benefits make a lot of profit. In conclusion, in on the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it. I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival. Yours sincerely",2.3T,0102_2000_12

So the rules are clear, you need to participate to in the lessons and also be successful at pass the exam of in June 2000. In our class, we don't have a problem with students who dislike to work working, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say stay there for years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long. In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society out, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons people. It is the same in our family and for. For example, my parents dislike hearing music in throughout the whole house or that I let dust everywhere. When I go out, they don't give me an hour a time to be at home, because I don't exagerate exaggerate I'm sensible.

I went to all the events, they were really good. I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world, even if the number of countries was very little small, only six. Why don't you let more countries to participate participate next year? I also liked the concerts. But, can I give you a suggestion for next year? Try to find bigger halls, because this year they were really too small! I enjoyed all the plays and films, but they were fewà why don't you broadcast more at the next Festival? I also went to the dance shows, the art exhibition and the talks by writers, they were really very nice and interesting. I also agree with you about the ticket's prize price. In fact, it was really a reasonably-priced ticket, excellent because you could go to all the events only just with it. And that's the reason because why lots of people came.

In my country there are different rules at school, but I think they are, more or less, the same in England. You have to begin your lesson at 8.25 and wait for the teacher of the next lesson in the class. You have a break of ten minutes, that you would have to do in class. You can't speak during the lesson or outside the classrooms. You can't write on walls and desks.. I have some rules also at home, but they are few. I can do everything I want, except going out with the car during the night. My parents are afraid of it because I took got my licence only only got my licence in September. My parents also like eating all together, but it isn't a rule, only an a habitude habit ! I don't think there is something anything I'd like to change! I like my life, both at school and at home!

"2 Desember December, 2000 Dear Mrs Clark: I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added in to next year's International Arts Festival, wich which in my opinion has been a great idea to create. Although I have read read that Starts Stars stars and Artists artists came frome from around the world, I have realised realised that they only came from only six countries. I spent had a good time in at the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personaly personally think that It it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films. The rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive,. I think that the ticket was exellent excellent for us because of its price. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly sincerely",4.1,0102_2000_12

Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express give my suggestion suggestions and recommendations. Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there were was some variety of features in it there. Next, One one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also a fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything by with the that ticket. However, according to my notes, there are some doubt doubts in about the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact in fact only from six countries. The number of plays and films were was also very few small. In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts. On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars from more than six countries and rebuild build larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken take place. I would be grateful happy to support you providing that you would like want to make the festival more successful.

The International Arts Festival is a beautiful wonderful idea. I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent, considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money. In your advertisment advertisement you mentionned mentioned that there is would be artists and stars from all around the world coming coming from all around the world, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented. I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the Festival festival if it is possible. It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kind kinds of music and to discover different culture cultures. Hoping that I did not offend have not offended you in any ways way and that you might take in into consideration my suggestion suggestions, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.

The night he came into this world, was one of grater even if for the habitants inhabitants of the country or and even also of the town where he was born, it was a an casual ordinary night. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up lit up all the land. Only the one ones who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was had been born. When the three men saw him, they fell on their knees to worship him. The mother was pride proud because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins. This little man from Israel died as the hero of all times.

"Jane Clark, The organiser Organiser, I am writting writing to you to give your you my opinion about your festival. It was great, but I think it could be even better next year. First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries were here participated. So, if you can could have more than six countries, it could would be great. This idea is in relation with relates to the number of plays and films. If there are more stars and artists from around the world, there are more plays and films and and there are more plays and films it is would be better. My second complain complaint is about some of the concert halls which are were too small. It would be better if you have had some more large halls, like your ""Arena"" hall. To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one a reasonally reasonable price, because for someone who do does not like especially especially like art, it was very attractive. A My least last suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some ""salsa"" band bands,. It would be great to listen and dance in at the same time to ""salsa"" music.

"Dear Jimmie, I was very happy to receive a letter from you. I am writting writing to you to answer at your question about school rules and what I am (and I am not) allowed to do at home. Firstly, in the school it is not permitted to smoking smoke in the no smoking no-smoking area or in the classroom. But, I think it is the same in England. Secondly, when you want to ask a question to the teatcher teacher to ask the teacher a question, you must to put put your hand up, and speak when the teacher ask asks you. In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can might disturbe disturb my familly family. For example, put putting the music on too hight high loud when my syster sister is working. But there are also some life's general rules, like do not put your legs feet on the table when we are eating or do not eat with my your fingers. There are is not really anything that I could would like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries.

"Dear Ms Clark, I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me - the dances dance shows were absolutelly absolutely wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dances dance shows. The Dancers dancers worn wore nice clothes, and the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefere prefer them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it they needs need more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was exciting excited about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all the plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the evants events because we could change our planes plans during the evant event. I suggest to organize organizing the next IAF in the summer. We are both students so we have our holiday from July to September. We have more free time in the summer. We're going to We would attend the IAF any time, as well. Thank you for an unusual event. Yours sincerely",2.3T,0102_2000_12

Most of studenst students wear jeans and a sweaters sweater. We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school-bags school bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. It This is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever.

On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary necessary compulsory. We aren't allowed to smoke and or drink any alcohol. We aren't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers. It This is also horrible. We musn't mustn't talk to them but must only listen to them.

It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules then to Polish schools but may be maybe we might find sth something incomon in comon in common ?!. What rules do we have in our schools? The first First of all, it dipends depends what kind of school it is ? : Primary, highschool high school or university !. I think that now Polish schools are going foward forward making progress but they still have lots of bad habits. Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have less fewer pracite practical lessons, and sometimes it's hard to get a books or other neaded needed things things needed for to study studying. The Conneat conneat connect connection relations hip between students and their teachers or principals is very poor! During the lesson lessons we are not allowed to have food or stg drink, and we can't be late to school. School is supose suppose supposed to be our second home but it's not. we We work hard and for at the end of our education we still have nothing. You asking ask me what would I change? I would make schools more less unstressfull stressful, with added fun cause 'cause it's easeyer easier that way that way it's easier to learn and I would gives give students more chances to share yo with their fantazy fantasy fantasies at school. Maybe the Polish system is not bad, but it's conftyble comfortable too.

For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes - whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom in at any time we want. Of course we can go out of the classroom in at any time.

"16th, Dec. 2000 Dear Mr. Clark, I'm writing this letter to complain and to suggest something about your ""International Arts Festival"". I visited the festival for 2 days. I also read an advertisement in ""The Times"". I thought it would be interesting and exciting. When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good. I was impressed of with the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culture cultures and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for a student too. However, you said ""Stars and artists from around the world"" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' concert halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except for these two things, it was quite good. I'd like to suggest this - concerned with concerning plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad there weren't enough. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival. I'm looking forward to hearing your answer.

"I'd like to tell you about my experiences. Before that, you have to think about why you need to earn money and how you do that. It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose. Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much more than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration concentration to on the my study studies and I spent the money to on entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old. Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer computers at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user computer-user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was a part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works work. I could earn money, and also I I also got a career. Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult hard, but I think that was an easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So the lose loss was bigger than the profit. In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose a proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too. If you haven't a purpose, you would will waste money easily and quickly.",3.3,0102_2000_12

The idea of an ""International Art Festival"" was great. But I feel the word of ""International"" was not really suit suitable ; because you just only got had six countrie's countries' stars and artists came. I think you should invite more than ten countries. The other problem was choosing space. Like As, as the hall of the classical concert was too small and crowded. Next year, you should calulate calculate or examine how many people come will come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was plays and films. It can show more for next year's festival. The Dance Shows as well. And the offer of a "" weedend weekend ticket"" was an excellent idea.

Our teachers are very strick strict, we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down!, "",. We can't talk during lessons and we only have a en ten minutes minute ten-minute break at 10.30 a.m. If we're late, we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature to go to class. It's hard to be extremely quite quiet for five hours but I reckon it's a good way method of education. On the other side On the other hand, I feel free at home. I help doing the cleaning or the washing, but I do it because I want to, not because my parents make me do it. I can go out and stay out late, I've got my car and my mobile, so that they can call me whenever they need to hear speak to me; but above all I know they trust me and consider my me an adult. Therefor Therefore I wouldn't change anything in my home life and neither or in my school life. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes.,",5.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ms., I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed with the exhibitions of at the festival that you had organized organized. Furthermore, it's a worthful worthwhile experience for people who want to know about the other countries' arts. But I would like to suggest make some requests for regarding the festival. Firstly, it is would be better to invite more artists not only from six countries. For example, the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere. Secondly, some concert halls were too small to enter contain all of the audience. Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time. I would prefer like to be held more performances more performances to be held next year in the bigger halls. Finally, regards to with regard to tickets, it is a very really wonderful idea because it is more combinient convenient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people. You may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year. Yours Sincerely",2.3,0102_2000_12

"Dear Jane Clark Hello! My name is Yuna Kimber who attended this annual International Arts Festival. I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul helpful for you to prepare for the next festival to you. First of all, I appreicate appreciate congratulate you for organizing such an exciting festival. It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself to at this festival so very much. By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries. And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt stuffy suffocated. I hope you'll get much bigger concerts concert hall halls next year. On the other hand, the plays and films were excellent. I expect that much more various varied kinds of plays and films will be on next year. Finally, I'd like to mention the reasonably-priced weekend ticket. It was brillient, because if I had to pay for all things each individually I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me. Thank you very much about for that. I hope it will be helpful and useful for you. Bye for now Faithfully yours",2.2,0102_2000_12
"International Arts Festival Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you for about your advertisement for the festival. I am a student at London College and studying English. I have always been interesed interested in arts and festivals. It was great that you organised the Art Arts Festival in this City city, because people realy really needed need this kind of sochibal social activities activity here. I have spent spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friend friends and I must say we were realy really delighted, it was a great idea to do that in London. We all liked the Jazz jazz, rock and classical concerts. However, the concert halls were too small and lots of people couldn't get in to into the concert halls and there were only six countries stars and artists stars and artists from only six countries. I believe there plays and films should be more should be more plays and films than it was for next year and the stars and artists should be from round around the world. One reasonably priced reasonably-priced weeker ticket for all events was excellent because its it's alway always busy for at the weekend and people prefer to go any week day weekday. I hope, you will concider consider about my opinions and that my suggestions would will be helpful for the next year. Look I look forward to hearing from you. Your Yours Sincerely sincerely",3.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Freddie I received your letter just this morning. It was very nice to hearing hear from you. We never like rules, do we? However there are lots of rules in our lives, both at home and at school. In my countries country country's school schools we are not allowed to have an argument with class-mates classmates and are not allowed to eat at in class. We can't listen to music at in class as well either. We alway always have to keep clean every where everywhere everywhere clean, but this these kind kinds of rules are not very strict I believe. At home it is completely different, my mum is quite organised, so she always puts makes is always making new rules. Firstly, I've I have to keep clean my room my room clean and hoover once a week. I've I have to cook myself and the worst thing is I'm not allowed to listen to loud music in everywhere anywhere at home. I'm not allowed to stay out after midnight. When I groue grow up I'll change all the rules in my life and I'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict. Love Look forward to hearing from you soon. Love",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about the International Arts Festival, which I went to recently. I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual. I think that the International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in at the weekend due to my work working in on the weekday weekdays so that I had time to go and did not have to care worry about the ticket price. In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about. Firstly, there was were a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention mentions mentioned that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year. Therefore Then, there will would be more people coming to the concerts. Finally, food shops should be added in to this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive attractive enought enough to get audiences. I would be grateful if you could consider my opinion above,. Yours sencirely sincerely,",2.3T,0102_2000_12
"Dear Karrie, Hello. How are you doing? I've been also also been considering thinking about rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out wheneve whenever I want, even in at the mid-night midnight. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home. There is are a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite an unusual rule in a Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly Secondly, boys are not allowed to have long hire hair. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't have make up make-up on at school at all. I want to at least put lip coluor colour lipstick on. I wish I could change this rule. I'll be grade glad if you let me know about your rules at school and at home. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes.",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark, The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you for on the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there must should be some improvements to make this festival better. Firstly, there were stars and artists only from from only six countries. This number may should be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concerts concert holls halls were too small for this much many people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you are were very successful about at finding good stars. The films and plays were not so very many there were not very many films and plays. As a result of this the kinds of films were not enough there were not enough kinds of films. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say with about the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted any all kind kinds of people. Another paht point is the tickets. The weekend ticket is excellent because it is not so very expensive and it allows you to see everything. But I was disappointed that there were was no competition between the films performed shown. I think there should be an Oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films.",4.2,0102_2000_12

I don't went want to be so evel evil about school but the rules are rules and they are limiting us with within the borders of our school. We must wear the uniform-like clothes all the day and all week. They don't even let us to wear wear different sweaters -, etc other than dark blue. It is boring. We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase because the teachers think that we are chatting. How poor their imagination imaginations are!! However we are free at home. You could can do anything you like as long as you have good grades. If you don't, you hear the same word every day, ""Study, Study, Study""! Nobody likes to study but we have to.

"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited attended. First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great. It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' cultural variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from from only six countries. Whereas, whereas an the advertisement promised stars from around the world. Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although,, although some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival. Another disadvatage disadvantage of the festival's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best to display the a modern county's country's culture., I suppose think. I hope there will be more of them next year. I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time times and there was were plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced reasonably-priced. In conclusuon conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done made. For example, the next year's one may could last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for a greater amount number of people. The programme can could be also also be improved by adding new categories such as folk songs. Thank you for your kind attention. Sincerely yours,",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Everybody wants to earn a bit of money. Especially young people who are always out of their small budget. Fortunatelly Fortunately, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays. Of course, young people can work only in their spare time. It mean means that a job should be part-time. So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities ability, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting, you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish English, for example. Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy, however. But you can earn more. Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday. But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may chose choose a the more pieceful peaceful job of a typist at home. There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer. So, you can help them and earn quiete quite enough. To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in the Arctic.",3.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ms Clark, I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate you on the organization. I am also writting writing to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion for about next's next year year's festival. An internation international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were starts stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the possibility opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures. In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favorite favourite classic classical concert concerts, ""La Moldava"" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough enough money, it will would be better to have the possibility opportunity to watch more movies. I am glad to tell you that one reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because also people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival. I would like to give make a suggestion. I think that meeting writers, dancers, musicians and artists could should be very interesting for anybody. Yours sincerely",3.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear George, Thank you very much for your recent letter. I'm very happy that you are well. When I read your letter I was surprised because I didn't know that you have had so many rules both at school and at home. In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht strict. Nobody has to be should be late in the morning because it is important to respect your class mades mates classmates classmates' and teachers' effort of getting to get up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour behaviour manners. There isn't a any kind of punishment for people who do these things. My parents are very good. The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lays lies. It's important for them that I tell them where I'm going if I go out and what time I think of I'll be coming back home. I can do what I like doing but I have to study. This is the only condition regarding to do doing what I prefer want. There isn't anything that I'd like to change. Write soon Love",4.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ms clark Clark : I am writing to give suggestion suggestions for regarding the international art festival, which I have been went to one weeks week before ago. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year. Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it. It is very interesting, especially for the young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time there very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world would be there on in the advertisement, but in fact they are were from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls are were too small, could. Could you consider making them bigger next year. ? The plays and films were really wonderful, people. People liked them very much, so could you play have more next year ? The last thing is about the ticket. It was excellent about to have one reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also also be like this. I hope that you can consider my suggestions. I really look forward to going to the festival next year. Yours sincerely:",3.2,0102_2000_12

I'm really sorry I didn't write you back write back to you immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you. In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In, in school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet toilet during the lessons, we. We should go have to go there in the brake break. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt strict,. I don't like it. If I can could, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success succeed at once, we. We should give them a second chance to try succeed. Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home, - I just don't take make trouble to for my family, that's. That's all. OK, just here. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

"Mrs. Jane Clark, I see saw your advertisement about the Internal International Arts Festival now. I think that's a great idea. As as we need some good activities. The Advertisement advertisement is written writes states that you invite stars and artist artists from around the world. This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote you wrote down artists from only six countries. I think you should invite people from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world. If you invite from more countries to stars and artist artists invite stars and artists from more countries, your festival will be unbelieved unbelievable. The Second second point is there are some jazz, rock and classical concerts. It's a good idea but some concert halls are too small. Because of these this, people are bored quickly. You show plays and films. I congradulate congratulate you because it's that's perfect. The most important thing is dance shows. As as more most people like dance shows, me too including me. That's the real knowledge for us, art exhibition exhibitions and talks by writers. I think we know will know a writer writer's life or how is he he is writing about it ? it's. It's a very significant thing. Lastly, you said 'one reasonable-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events'. It's excellent. If you can pay attention to my small suggestion, next year I hope it will be an unbelievable festival. THANKS! Yours sincerely!",S,0102_2000_12

"Dear Jane Clark, The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival Festival I attended last weekend. I believe that the event was good, however. However, I feel that the festival can could be improved next year. Firstly, I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround around the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries. I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go come to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet some other personalities. Secondly, I belive believe you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small. I would be very thankful grateful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year. Last but not least, I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly separately. I hope you find my opinion opinions useful. Once again, congratulations on the Festival. I hope to hearing hear from you soon, yours Yours sincerelly sincerely,",5.2,0102_2000_12

"Dear Mary, Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry for not having written earlier, but I've had an exhausting exam session at school. It was very interesting to hear about the rules in England. The rules in Poland are quite similar to those discribed described in your letter. We are not allowed to talk during the lesson lessons and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniforms uniform, but there are schools, in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably lessen reduce the amount of homework. It's hard to find any spare time sometimes! What about home house rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home. All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them. Anyway, I must finish now. Has your dog already now recovered recovered now ? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Lots of love,",4.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mr/Mrs Sir/Madam, I've seen attended I attended your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to for it. I must say that the International Arts Festival is really a great idea. And your last festival was very intresting interesting too. But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year's festival to make it absolutelly absolutely wonderful. First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there are were people only from six countries. I think it can make your festival more popular. Jazz, rock and classical concerts are amazing, but I think that some concert halls are too small, so not everybody can come. Your dance shows are very beautiful, the art exhibitions exhibition is something original and exciting. And also it is very interesting to talk with writers. I think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an exellent excellent idea because it isn't so Expensive expensive as buying a ticket to for each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue to making holding your festivals. Your Yours faithfully,",2.3T,0102_2000_12
"Dear Tom, How are you? Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting. The question you asked me in it is very original too. I must say that the rules aren't the same in the schools of our country. Every school has it's its own rules. I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students. We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem. So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers teachers. I'm allowed to do many things at home. My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right. And the main reason Why why our family is so friendly, it's is because we haven't go got many rules. So, I think there isn't something anything I'd like to change. I hope everything is good in your family and your school. Take care,",3.2,0102_2000_12

"Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to you to tell you that I enjoyed the International Arts Festival held on 21-22 November this year. I liked the plays and the films most. Some films were really wonderful. You had picked up unknown but talented directors' films and they were really worth watching. And the concerts were also excellent. Especially In particular, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore. However, I found some things which I think I should point out. Some concert halls were not big enough to have hold the audience. For next year, I think you should take this matter into consideration,.

One day, the lady went to a river to wash their clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees. In a bamboo forest, he found a shining piece of bamboo. When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it. She was named the bamboo princess. The princess grew up to be beautifully beautiful. Some princes proposed to her.

"Dear Jane, I am writing to you to give you some advice about the International Arts festival Festival. I think it is a great idea to organise this sort of festival because most of people enjoy it. Firstly, concerning the stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics music like jazz and rock, it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about bigger halls, it will be would be better. Secondly, about the plays and films, it will be would be good if you make have had more because the children like it them. The dance shows was were very absolutely wonderful, like art exhibitions. Do not change about the talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their owns own books.

"Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing in response to your advertisment advertisement in Today's today's newspaper. I recently spent two days at the International arts festival Arts Festival and I found it very entertaining. It was really a a really good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows. The idea that I prefered preferred liked the most was to suggest a the reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student students or and unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money. I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, he the concert hall was too small. Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries. A friend of mine went to see the play ""Hamlet"" and the film ""Gladiators"". He told me how great it they was were and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year. In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in the sommer summer. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerly sincerely,",4.3,0102_2000_12

Firstly, in your advertisement it states: stars and artist artists from around the world, and but this year they were one only from six countries.

I very a lot enjoy enjoyed on it them enjoyed them a lot, but some of the halls are too small. I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied. Another thing, plays and films. I saw only 2 plays and 3 films. For me it is too little few. One of the reasons that I have visited your art arts festival was to saw see a lot of plays. In the future, I supposed suppose hope to be an actress and that's way why I want to learn something from the professionalists professionals. I hoe hope that next year I will. The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have a weekend-price weekend price ticket. This is an excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it by with the whole family at the weekend and see all events in for a reasonaby-price reasonable-price reasonable price. I believe hope that you consider my opinions. If you can't consider all of then them, I would like only one: more and once more plays! Yours faithfully Yours sincerely",2.3T,0102_2000_12

When I knew found out it there was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small so that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all the events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money. Although that Festival was not well-organized well organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform show more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate would really appreciate it if you would take took into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls. I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions.

"It is really nice to hearing hear from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other. Personally, I can not cannot imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others. As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive arriving in on time and get getting on with every teacher and authority figure. As a consequence, most mates schoolmates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them. At home it is the other way about round. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting invite friends over, watching watch TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate help out with the house-keeping housekeeping household chores and meal meals. That is all! Hope I hope you enjoy my experiences.

"Dear Madam, I'm writing to You you in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at to. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it ""international"" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists ( mentioned said to be ""from around the world"") were from only six countries. Maybe the eason reason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones. On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose from impressed me the most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year. I also thank you for the excellent idea of having one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in. My suggestion for next year's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer! Yours faithfully,",4.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Friend, Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it. If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them in a nutshell briefly. We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on or signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters winter we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's school floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes shoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write writing exams which are in polish Polish schools very often very often in Polish schools. At home I don't have many rules either. I must wash the dishes from time to time (I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty) and clean our house. I don't think there is anything I'd like to change. I'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours! Your Yours faithfully,",5.2,0102_2000_12
"25th November 2000 Dear Mr Clark, I have seen saw your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday. Most of the events were wonderful and well-organised well organised. I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my inmature views view of it. Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I It made allowed people enjoyed to enjoy their weekend, relaxed relax themselves, and also it brought the a foreign culture to them, enlarged enlarging broadening their kownlegth knowledge. In addition to it this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10, this. This was excellent, it. It made meant people only spend spent pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked weekend, for. For them it is a really economical way to spent spend their weekend. So my friends told me that this was his their cheapest weekend. Moreover, the stars and artists were only from from only six countries,. In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting interesting, and from my point of view in my opinion, some of the concert halls were too small, the. The people in there couldn't even go to the loo !, because it was too crowed crowded. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show have more play plays and films, It it will achieve have a good effect. This These are only my inmature immature views, if. If it is considerable for you, I will be very pleased, thank. Thank you very much. I'm look looking forward to hearing receiving your replies reply. yours sincerely,",3.2,0102_2000_12

The concerts are fabulous but the problems problem are is the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something for about these problems? All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of ""Plays and films Films "". I love films and Plays plays also, and I'll hope I hope to have more films or Plays plays next year. Concerning the tickets, I think your price is reasonable for this festival. It is a good idea to have reasonably-priced tickets for weekends. I'm looking forward do to hearing from you,. Yours faithfully sincerely,",3.2,0102_2000_12

But firstly, I want to congratulate you for on organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of events event. Secondly, I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it was written wrote said so in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented,. I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave microwave an oven inside. Plays The plays and Films films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year. One of the most positive aspect aspects of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket. As a student, the low priced ticket certainly athacted attracted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists. Finally, I would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a camping campsite so that people who come from a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation accommodation. Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year. Yours sincerely,",5.1,0102_2000_12
"Money, Money, Money Young people always need money, specially especially students who don't earn their life living. They need money to pay for their studies or for going out, but how to find a job which is good and not under-paid underpaid ? One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore, departement department stores are always looking for students who would like to work. Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night. Unfortunately, it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning. If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons, which is one of the most prolific job jobs, but do it only if you like teaching. Otherwise you should try to find another job. The main thing to remember is that there are many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: ""I want to work and earn money"".",5.3,0102_2000_12

Firstly I want to congratualate congratulate you for on the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was were only starts stars from six major countries. I suggest you to increase increase this number for the next year. By In this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will want to point on out is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter get into the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? The Last last thing that I will say is ""one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"". It was a very good idea. I hope you will make do the same thing next year. These are the my suggestions. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year in at the festival. Yours Sincerely sincerely",3.3,0102_2000_12

I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festivel festival, connected with art and culture. Especially In particular, the date was very suitable for me, as I have a lot of free time. What is more, there was a wide vareiety variety of music. Although the artists were supposed to be from all counties countries, there were only six nationalities. I hope that next year there will be much many more possibilities to enjoy films or plays and that the halls will be bigger, as they were overcrowded.

To begin with, I'd like to show you how what are my obligations my obligations are at school. Although we have to change our boots shoes, we don't need to wear special uniforms. Our clothes should be in a good taste. We are also allowed to have jewellery and a make-up, what's which is especially crucial important for girls. When it goes comes to my home, I think I have the usual duties : I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. However Furthermore, my parents aren't demanding, : I have to be home at the least latest at by 11 o'clock by 11 o'clock at the latest and tell them where I go am going out.

"Dear Miss Clark, I have recently taken part in your International Arts Festival. I enjoyied enjoyed it and here are some feelings and advice for next year. First of all, it was a great idea to put together different countries to organise this Festival festival. However, there were only artists from six countries, not as written in your add ad advertisement. Then I had the pleasure of listening to your variety of concerts. Each one was fantastic and fill in with euration, but I'd appreciate more place space, because unfortunately some concert halls were too small! You certainly saw that the plays and films had a lot of success. So, I wanted to know if there will be more films next year. It could be an advantage ! An other Another excellent thing was your choice for the entry. That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events. That was simpler than an the other way of selling tickets (practical and attractive ). Finally, I want you to make a suggestion for next year. It would be better if people have had had the possibility chance to let park their cars very near to the Festival festival during the week-end weekend ! I am sure you'll pay attention to my suggestions and advice and I am looking forward to seeing you next year. Yours sincerely,",4.1,0102_2000_12

They were near a little house, built in of wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family. They ate with the owner of the little house, whose name was John. It was very quiet because they were in the nature countryside ; they could just hear the cows and John's two dogs. Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects in out of wood.

"Dear Sir, First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea. I enjoyed it and found it worthy worth to visit visiting. The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with the stars and artist artists coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get used acquainted to with more cultures by inviting guests from some other countries too. The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in. So I could hardly participated participate in attend all of the concerts. The organisation was very good. I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year. It was really a reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend for me, but you should also recognise introduce new activities like competitions on in singing songs, or drawing a portrate portrait next year. Then it would be excellent. Thanks for everything. Yours Sincerely faithfully,",4.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ana, I have received your letter. It is nice to hear from you again. I'm in a hurry, so I will directly come come directly to the point. Everywhere and at everytime every time in our lives we face are faced with the rules. Some find view them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them. For me they are both. At schools school we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk. I think these are international rules which help things to go progress in order. Contrary On the other hand there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones ones about clothing. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and we feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in what we wearing wear. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class course. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study for or if we are ill. At homes home we have again again have rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to the dining table, respectful, do your home works homeworks homework and watch TV less and not too loud. I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power. They are against democracy I think. Anyway hope to hear from you soon. With all my love,",5.1,0102_2000_12

It would be wonderful if there were stars from more than six countries next year, the festival would be even more interesting then. I also think the places you have chosen for the classical concerts were not good sometimes, some of the halls seemed to be too small. But your idea about the weekend ticket is just excellent, people from the whole country get the opportunity to visit your festival and see all the events you are offering. I've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival. You could probably show a little bit few more films and interviews with the most interesting artists. I'm sure it would attract lots of young people. Well, thank you very much for this festival, my friends and I have enjoyed it a lot. Yours sincerely,",5.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Dave, Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you. Howe How are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk bout about our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow. Hope it will be interesting for you. Bu By the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teaches teachers don't let us smoke, of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest. We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches teachers. As for our rules at home, it's always different and depends just just depends on your family. My parents are not very strict, as you know, and I appreciate them for giving me freedom. They understand that I can make my own decisions, but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother nay any time we need it. I think the only rule in my house is to care bout about each other. I hope to hear from you soon",5.1,0102_2000_12
"Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to thank you for providing arranging the International Arts Festival. It was an absolutely great idea. However, I would like to give some suggestions for next year as I have read the advertisement. Firstly, could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries countries ? In my opinion, it might be better to have time with a variety of nationallites nationalities. Secondly, the music concerts were very exciting and I had a lot of fun, but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably. Thirdly, I am expecting to watch more films and plays, which were impressive. Lastly, it could be nice to for students who are interested in the arts, if you help offer special events, for instance, a song contest, writing competition or dance lessons. To sum up, I hope the festival is developed organised next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket tickets like this year's. Yours sincerely,",3.3,0102_2000_12

I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. As I saw on in the advertisement, there were would be stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries represented. It would be better if there were more than six countries. I noticed that some concert halls were too small. I wonder if you could offer organise outside outdoor concerts. Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films. Don't you think you could create provide dramatic drama courses? Visitors could learn plays with professionals. Finally, the idea of a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we pay only once and we can see all the events. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

I don't think the rules are so different between England and France but I'm going to try to give you examples. Firstly, at school, if we missed a course class, we must bring a medical attestation doctor's note. Furthermore, when we failed fail an exam in June, we can have take it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE. At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch.

"Dear Mrs Jane Clark I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with the International Arts Festival, which was organised by you last year. However, I think that International Arts Festival is a great idea and but I suggest you prepare it better. Firstly, it was written on in the advertisment advertisement that there would be stars and artist artists from around the world. I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artist artists from only six countries and in my opinion there should be more. Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls, which in my opinion were too small. That was the reason why some people were complaining. Thirdly, I suggest you should put more plays and films on next year, because watching them is a very nice way of spending our freetime free time. Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea about of giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was excelent excellent because it attracted peoples' people's attention. Lastly, I'd like to give you a piece of advice. I suggest you invite some film stars, because they are very famous and people like them. I hope you'll look into these matters and improve the festival next year.

"Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make makes the world go round, so they always look for a job with a big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time free time than waste it. In my opinion, the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities of to earn earning some money but of course the young are not able to get a well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated experienced and educated enough. They have to think about some season seasonal jobs. Firstly, the a good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are are often not able to do their shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and a permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are a good mathematic mathematician you can be a seller.

When I found the advertisement of for the International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the this place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show shows etc. The specified thing that is worth to remind reminding remembering here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist tourists could offer what they like liked. Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something some thing some things that needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert concert halls which was were too small to hold so much many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience. In the addition, when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films. ?

"Dear Magda It is lovely to get your letter so soon. You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind reminds me of what I experienced during my teeenage teenage years. In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at in the first year of being a teenage teenager. Your You know, this age is the trouble troublesome age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These They always annoy the school teacher schoolteacher and their parents. In As a result of these this, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in the class. They had have to finish homework in within a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make up make-up and or wear any accessories jewellery. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much a lot of amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden forbade me to make have a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friend friends had the same experience. Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all both in the school. Comparing Compared to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of to them and a friend of to them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't doesn't give students so much homework, and don't doesn't forbidden forbid the opposite voice of the students, there are is nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad. I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon. Best wishes",2.3,0102_2000_12
"Dear Mrs. Jane X, I would like to make some appoitments appointments comments about the event that I had been went to. First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think it should be bigger for jazz, rock or still even classical concerts. Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year year's events, such as the following : - Funny plays and films to spend the break time break ; - Dance shows after dinner to have provide something interesting to do in the night, ; - Art exbitions exhibitions to know teach us more things about the artist's lifestyle; and - talks by writers to say how good is his latest book his latest book is. In addictions addition, the ticket's tickets' price tickets is are too expensive and it is difficult to buy another a new one every day, so. So, I think it is would be more effective if there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. In conclusion, I hope believe it will be better next year if these points was were are observed for the each year the event to be better than before. Sincerely",2.1,0102_2000_12

Here are some opinions and suggestions: Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries. Additionally, some concert halls were too small to relax in, while though most of them were very comfortable. It was a pity for me that there were fewer plays and films than I had expected. I suggest to you that you should organise more next year. On the other hand, there were was a lot that impressed me very much. For example, there was one reasonably-priced reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events. It is a very good way to increase the number of music-lovers.

To their surprise, there was a boy in the peach! They named him Momotaro, and looked after him. The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much a lot of money and many a lot of treasures treasure.

"Dear Ms Jane Clark. I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently. The festival was excenent excellent in many ways, and especially in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with at the proper normal price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic. However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars who participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences attendees. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres of in neither the films nor either the films or the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year. I hope that next year's festival will be much more successful that than this year's one. Yours sincerely,",4.2,0102_2000_12
"The Old Man and the Sea People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do prefer unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'. Above all, realistic stories teach me something of about the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways. In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives. We all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality. That's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones.",5.2,0102_2000_12
"Dear Ms Clark, I had recently spent recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival. It was the first time I went have been and I was very pleased to go. I, actually, Actually, I wasn't disappointed. However I would like to give my opinion about the festival. First of all, I congratulate you on making organising this kind of event. It was such a good great success that some people weren't able to have get tickets! You should increase the number of places you give offer. Therefore, you could invite artists from around the world and not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant. Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts concert halled halls too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were some interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly meet some producers, who come from others other countries in order to show different cultures. Besides, to pay buy one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time. Finally, I suggest to invite inviting important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it they also are a kind of art! I look forward to seeing attending the next festival! Yours sincerely,",4.1,0102_2000_12
"16/12/2000 Dear Jane Clark, First of all, I'd like you to know that the whole organization was nearly almost excellent. I spent two nice days at the festival full of art. The idea of making the festival ""international"" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were being too small. The Plays plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joined attended the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows made were a sight for our sour sore eyes, ; they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, not to mention their life styles lifestyles, by talking to them. Beyond In addition to all these that, the application idea of joining in all the activities by with one nice-priced nice nicely reasonably priced ticket was excellent ; because it saved you from having buying to buy one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and others other things, and also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect. Thank you for making holding a great festival which made all the art arts activities come together. Yours Sincerely sincerely,",5.1,0102_2000_12

By the way, it would be better If if you wrote quite often to me to me quite often. The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very diciplined disciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours behaviour. I understand the second part, but I can't get understand the reason of for wearing in white an and dark blue only only wearing white and dark blue. Do we become the ""perfect one"" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much more free freer at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want at in my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them. Don't ever forget to write to me, okay? Love,",4.1,0102_2000_12
"17th December, 2000 Jane Clark, organizer Dear Madam, I'm writing this letter to congratulate you for on the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy enjoyed last November. I found think it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think can could be improved in the following future editions years. First of all, because of the advertisement I expected starts stars and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures may could make the festival even more interesting. Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found find that some of them were sold out because of the short reduced number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can might be a good idea to set arrange more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week week's festival. Finally, the prize price was reasonably reasonable and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend. I hope you'll attend act on my suggestions. Yours sincerely,",3.3,0102_2000_12

I would like to express my opinion about it and give you some suggestions that may prove to be useful. First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also refers goes to for the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time. On the other hand, I would like to notice point out that the festival would could be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made. Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform. Actually, they came from only six countries. What is more, some concert halls were too small.

"Dear Magda, Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some of the school and home rules in my country, France. First of all, and I think it's a big difference with very different in England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me. Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, and be polite with the teacher and the other school children schoolchildren. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard,. I mean as regards the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( though not always) but also speaks with them. At home it is different, each. Each family has its own rules. As I am concerned As far as I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise clever child, so. So ! Usually, usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules, like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noise nose ""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere. Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon. With lots of love,",4.2,0102_2000_12

The only thing that distracted me was the size of the concert halls. They were very small and I was pushed by everyone.

"Once upon a time there was a widow and a widower. They treated each other as if they were husband and wife. Around two years later there was a meeting. By that time the widow could not walk and the widower could not see. When the widower sensed that the widow badly wanted to go, the widow clung on the widower's back and set off telling him where to go. On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold. The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.

I think that it's is very important the development of the arts the development of the arts is very important and that everybody could assist attend without paying too much. Having a one ticket for all the events is a great method because it's an organised way of paying and you win save time. On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable comfortable comfortable enough to apreciate appreciate the event. Other Another thing, is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't cheat deceive the people by saying that they are from all over the world.

"Dear Jane, Thanks for your letter, : it was nice to hear from you again. I've recently started the classes so all the rules were given to us, like as you know, on the first day. As you want wanted me to tell you how about the rules are here what the rules are like here, I'll start. Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite quiet and sat sit down. You must pay attention always always pay attention because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either and you mustn't eat chuingham chewing gum or take a walkman Walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that those rules. My mum only just doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but I must telling tell her previously beforehand. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true truth. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says.

It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who was were in the theatre. First of all, I was looking forward to see seeing one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent different actor instead of him in spite of his name was being writen written in the advertisement. In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m. but, in fact actually, it began at eight fifteen. I also, found out that no discounts were available. In spite of it was being said in the advertisement. Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker cook has had had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables. In the advertisement there's no mention about of getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give it some back to me. Yours faithfully",3.2,0102_2000_6

"Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to complain about my deceiveful deceitful disappointing experience at your theatre last Saturday night. What I thought it was going to be a wonderful night became into the worst night at the theatre I've ever had. Firstly, I must admit that when we realised the main character actor had been changed we felt really disappointed. This is because I had been waiting to enjoy Danny Brook's performance since I saw him the first time on television. Secondly, despite of your advertisement advertising of the possibility of discounts, when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes employees she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole full prize price. Moreover, not only had the actor been changed but also the musical show started forty five forty-five minutes late.

Not only to play games or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school. I think that anything that can make our lifes lives better, should be done, because that way we wouldn't won't have so many things to be concerned about, and we would will be able to live a happier and more relaxed life.",4.3,0102_2000_6

He enjoyed himself reading, and playing piano at home. Despite his way of live life, his best friend was Anna, the most popular girl in the school. She explained told everything what that happened in her live life to Pat told Pat everything that happened in her life. When Pat was 16, he decided to change his way of live life, spending to spend more time with friends, but what he could could he do to have get some friends? Definately Definitely the worse. He started to ""sell"" the secrets of Anna Anna's secrets to all the boys of in the school who were interested in her. All the boys of in the class went to Pat to know find out what Anna was doing in at every moment, and Pat was becoming ' friend friends ' of with all the boys. He was very happy, because he felt that everybody loved him. Everyone, less apart from Anna. She didn't tell him anything more anymore, and Pat didn't have any secret secrets to sell to his ""new friends"".

"17.06.2000 Hello Sir, "" Um I'm very unpleased unhappy that I have to write you this letter. I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much. On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" in at the ""Circle Theater Theatre "". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but, when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points reasons because why, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play appear ! So when the miserable musical came to his its end, we were happy to leave the theater theatre room auditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes restaurants were opened open anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just found a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short small sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed because of for renovations""! We thought it would be was a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something anything. I would prefer getting to get my money back, instead of taking getting a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again! Sincerely Hedwiga Heinkel",2.3T,0102_2000_6

We, that were is Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me, Hedwiga, had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we won't wouldn't attack them. We had this idea first, when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love of first slight love at first sight and we were fascinated by the thought, of building a kind of the same the same kind of organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heaed heard of some people paying, "" safty-money safety-money "", but never know the reason, until he found a big large amout amount of money in my room. His thoughts combined mind made up and ready to go to the police he went out of left our house, where me and my homies friends were just hanging aroud around out. He saw me and tolled told me into to my face you, ""You are a thief and a burglar and I will go now now go to the police,."" I didn't know what to do,but then I had an idea....

"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your entertainment show which was advertised in the last edition of ""Plays"". I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected expected to meet find. First of all, the prices weren't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that. Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes. Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors. Especially In particular I was disappointed by Danny Brook, who made me nervous with his lack of talent. According to your advertisement, there was a an possibility opportunity to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed. After that, I should also mention, that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life. I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once.

"Come back Comeback Return to paradise There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what can be designed more more can be designed ? Can you imagine the a trend which will would be as shocking as it has never been ? The clothes Clothes is are part of each culture and one of these those things which expresses express our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays, it's getting obvious that designers sold sell only details, but and significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past, and only the fabrics are different. People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common ordinary clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit avoid the boredome boredom. I am sure that at last eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there. There won't be any problem with being up-do-date. As it was previously stated, I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important thing will be the body and the purity of our soul.",4.3,0102_2000_6

And if I were asked, what ""What will be completely different in the year 2100, "" I would say: clothes. Most of the scientists, when asked about the Earth in a hundred years, claim, that it is going to be absolutely scorching here then. In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more, the ground will be so hot, that going walking will only be possible in huge shoes, which should will be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be, that people won't be allowed to get go out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials, that aren't known yet. On the whole, we can only predict guess what clothes will be like in the year 2100. But in case my predictions are right, maybe you should buy a new pair of shorts?",4.1,0102_2000_6

"In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At first First, there are now a lot of things that most people use at home. For example: a fridge, a cooker or just an electricity. We couldn't imagine our life without them. Secondly, thanked thanks to the technology, there are many ways of travelling today. We produce cars, trains and plains planes which are better and better. What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement equipment. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe it there will be a remedium remedy cure against for AIDs or cancer soon. On the other hand, the modern technology has some disadvantages. The main one is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world. The second is the nuclear weapon weapons and the many wars, in which modern equipement equipment is used. To sum up, as far as I am concidered concerned, modern technology has changed my life completely. On the one hand, it helps me a lot in daily life, but on the other, I'm afraid of the future everyday every day.",3.1,0102_2000_6
"Dear Manager, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show, I have seen saw last week. There is some disagreement a between your advertisement and the show, which I could see saw at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I would like to indicate state that you put gave the wrong starting and finishing hours times. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have had mentioned stated. It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming getting back home at night - when it finished. Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook at on the stage. She He is my famous favourite artist and I was coming going went there mainly because of him. If this This made me really disappointed - he wasn't playing performing there. Another point, I want you to consider, is the restaurant. The place you have had offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you have had closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us with anything to eat? Finally, you have had advertised claimed, I would have a perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back. I think, this could be the only, right possibility way for me, to forget about my not interesting uninteresting evening. I would appreciate it, if you could consider my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully",2.3T,0102_2000_6
"FASHION OF THE FUTURE Try to imagine : the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny shiny large large shiny shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them. It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books. It's a REALITY, its it's the FASHION OF THE FUTURE... People were have been wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing has changed : style, colour, qual quality. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill until nowadays now are have been the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say tell will tell it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest next 100 years. The climate is changing, so we would will have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope, there will be times, when women would will like to be again again to be thought as delicate and sensible sensitive human beings. Showing their figure, they would have the possibility opportunity to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any no exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it that will be a thing of the past. Streets The streets of the 21st century will be smart. So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very poor. This fashion is coming, so think about it. Grey and black - like weather the seasons, like people people's charakters characters, like all the night and dark sourranding surrounding us. These are the colours of the FUTURE.",2.1,0102_2000_6

I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, but I had a bad surprise; he was not in the show! How could you change the actors without saying something to the visitors audience. The show was supposed to start at half past seven and started a at quarter past eight. Forty-five minutes later late ! It was incredible. Apart from that, the advertisement mention mentioned that there were discounts available, and there were not. It mention mentioned that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show, too, and we could not because it was closed, and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us. I am very disappointed, and if it is possible, I want you to return my money back. I hope that the next time you will do put on a better show than the last one. Yours faithfully,",3.3,0102_2000_6

"Mr. Circle Theatre's Manager I am writing to you complaining to complain for about the Play you are advertising as the ""London's Newest and Best Musical Show"" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience in of my whole life. I cannot bear it when somebody says something and then does just the opposit opposite way. To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know, that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says in the advertisements. What is more it there lasted were 45 minutes of waiting before it to start started and it did not supply satisfy all the expectations people had. On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all. Instead of him there was another actor who could neither act nor sing, and, even though, it was a Musical Show. The last thing I would like to complain for about is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed, because, as it said we were told, of ""VACATIONS"". If in the advertisements and leaflets says say ""VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW"" there are is not no reasons reason for it being closed. It should be opened open at least until all people everyone gets out of the place. It must be our decission decision whether to stay and eat there, or not. To make it shorter To cut a long story short, because of everything I have said before above, the correct thing to do for me for me to do is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just giving to give it back to me because of all the troubles trouble and disappointings disappointing disappointment feeling you made have made me suffer. I am looking forward to hear hearing from you as soon as possible.",2.3T,0102_2000_6
"HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY DAILY LIFES LIVES ? In times of our grandparents In our grandparents' time life was so different, that we cannot beleive believe that this huge change to our day daily life happened in only one hundred years or less. First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the our access to ability communication to communicate, traveling travelling to travel and geting getting to get information. You can now know what happens is happening on the other side of the world, at the same time as it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the ""enter"" key in on a computer. Furthermore, as we all know, day daily life now a days nowadays is quite simplier simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler colder. Strange as it seems, we now can have every all types of machine or especialized specialised technology to make our dayly daily life more confortable comfortable and less workable stressful. Things that human beings used to do, now are are now being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly. One the other hand On the other hand, despite the fact that technology make makes things easier in our day daily life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job jobs because they is are not needed they get fall into poorness poverty, criminal activities, being becoming become isolated and without the have no possibility chance of getting a good education. This is the most terribly terrible disadvantage technology has.

"Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about a musical show which I've seen recently at your theatre. There are several reasones reasons why I wasn't satisfied with it. Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor, Danny Brook, would play act in the show. Despite it that, a different actor stared starred in the performance, which was really disappointing. Secondly, the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be. Thirdly, no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets. Lastly, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show. That evening wasn't my perfect one out, although it was promised to be so in the advertisement. This is the main reasone reason, why I want to ask for a refund.

"Fashion of the Future. During Over the centuries man's clothes has have been changing and even developing in some way ways. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more common ordinary clothes. I think we can make draw a conclusion: during over the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common ordinary. People's clothes have been changing from metalwear armour to shorts and miniskirts. That's why I suppose, that man's clothes will be becoming more and more light lighter and lighter. I think, they will be made of universal materials, which will be rather light and thin. People won't be embarassed embarrassed to show the beauty of their bodies. Perhaps, clothes will be rather small. I think, that different tops and mini-skirts will become more popular. Maybe, people will create something even smaller than that.

Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you "" offered advertised "", has been changed. The man who played the main male role was different than this one, not the one who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start has been was changed, making your show delayed delaying your show for nearlly nearly one hour! In your offer advertisement I noticed an some information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another ""defect"" in the advertisement was an ""invitation"" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown for me reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information telling giving about a cause reason of for closing it). Finally, you guaranteed ""a perfect evening out"", but for me it was the worst visit in to the theatre in two years time. To sum up, I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre. Neither the beautiful surranding surroundings near your theatre nor the comfortable sits seats will not recompansate compensate compensated for my horrible evening.

It also changed my life-style lifestyle for the better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done, a washing machine which makes my clothes clean again.

Also fast and well-improved high-tech car cars increase a the risk risks of pollution of in our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents.

Maybe because of this, just like living things, the clothes have evolution evolve. This evolution has never stopped and it will continue. How What about the clothes of people, a hundred years later in a hundred years' time ? In my opinion the clothes of the world, after in a century century's time, will be styled in the a Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout the history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be ""out"". Of course, the technology will change too. Maybe, new kinds of fabrics, that are capable of insulating light, or heat will be used. Actually, some clothes like that are being developed today ;, but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future. Finally, it seems to me that, the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalist naturalistic and minimalist and also, the fabrics that are used will change too.

Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage. However, you changed actors without informing the viewers audience. As if this were not enough, the show was forty five forty-five minutes late. Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject. According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused being given a discount. On top of everything, the theatre restaurant was closed.

"Recently, we have had had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, and the internet Internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet see him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone phones I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through on the internet Internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients. However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing on the computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon ban cars from city centres, and closed close down factories which produce too much sewage waste. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also also be harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably wisely.",5.1,0102_2000_6
"Olivier Peissaud The Manager Circle Theater Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to complaint complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London. My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about for the show ""Over the Rainbow"", which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts discount tickets, we were said told there never were discount offers and that we had to pay for the highest most expensive tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off up. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait until 8.15 pm before it started, whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I. After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations decor were was being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the ""perfect evening"" as written in the adverstiment advertisement. So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy of them - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertisement advertising.

"Your children children's clothes in 100 years How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become come true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years, the clothes would will certainly be totally differents different than from ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are our minds too. So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium aluminium bottles. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see. I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic Synthetic materials have grown up developed and become very popular so it they would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed change : large pants as ""baggy"" ""baggy"" pants, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's men. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes dressing. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique tunic upon over a shirt and a skirt, or more male masculine clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that what. Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" movie movie ""Fifth Element"" is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view. To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about they will be today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy.",5.1,0102_2000_6

Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even if though I had read on the brochure flyer that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed.

Well they didn't accepted accept when I pay with my £20 discount tiket ticket why. Why ? And at last finally I couldn't visit the theater theatre restaurant after the show, it was closed, why. Why ?

"Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint displeasure about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook Danny Brook should have been there, starring in all the scenes. Instead, you changed the actor without any warning, so I didn't find see my favourite Danny Brook, with which was a my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up match him at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have get a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on in the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would should have a right on to it one. At the top of everything On top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated restructured repaired, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the troubles trouble you caused me. Yours sincerely,",3.2,0102_2000_6
"Most people think modern technologies aren't so as positive as they are often showed presented to be. My personal theory is completely different. I have always always have a good positive approach with all of the most recent invenctions inventions or any other kind of modern applications application appliance. We live in the age of personal computers, of the internet Internet, of the mobile phones phone, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It' It's already four years since I bought my first cellular phone ( since then I changed have changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend friends and to my family than before. Anyway, the thing that has most changed my daily life changed my daily life most is the personal computer and, expecially especially, the internet Internet. For example, now I'm writing my thesis, but I use my pc PC everytime every time I have to write a document in a perfect form that has to look perfect. Then, surfing in on the internet Internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic!",4.2,0102_2000_6
"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. First of all, the time for the second session was meant to be at 19.30, but somehow it began at 20.15, which was a 45 minutes delay. I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing of about that evening. But my complain complaint does not finish here. It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts. And what is more, I could not go to the restaurant after the show, as it was closed because the main chef was ill and could not come to work. Definetely Definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Alessandra Lane.",4.3,0102_2000_6
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As soon as she arrived home, she phoned her best friend Sue and told her everything, all details included. She also told her not to tell anybody about it because it was a secret. The thing was that Mary couldn't resist the secrecy and phoned her cousin, who also studied in our school. She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary didn't tell her it was a secret, so on monday Monday at 9 a.m. MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day, eventually everybody had read the ""news"". I didn't know it was published as I didn't read the paper and no one told me anything, either. But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to eachother each other. At first I didn't realise what was happening, but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed eachother each other in the park last friday Friday. Suddenly my face went all red and I ran towards the toilet. I had never felt so embarrassed and miserable in my life, but luckily next day almost everybody forgot about it. That day I swore to myself that I would never trust anybody again.",5.3,0102_2000_6
"17-6-00. Mr. Smith, I write to you because last night, (Saturday 10), I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre. I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another, horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to have get a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was not no discount neither either for her not for or anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets. Furthermore, it was announced supposed to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone no one would explain to the audience. After the play, we went to the theatre's restaurant and we found out that it was had been closed since 1999's spring spring 1999 ! How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant? In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't spend have the ""perfect evening"" you announce advertised.

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Although he had promised Lise that he wouldn't say a word, when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann. Of course, Ann promised not to tell anyone, but by the lunch-break lunch time all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams. Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would make do all her homeworks homework during for 3 weeks. There was no escape. It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell anything to the teachers tell the teachers anything, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise. Unfortunately, the perfect plan doesn't exist, and a teacher heard two students talking in the bathroom. The teachers started investigating and asking all the students, but it was a secret and they couldn't say a word. Finally, the teachers asked Lise and her friends. No-one said a word.

I've been recently seeing I recently saw this in your theatre during my week's holiday in London and I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was the London's newest and best musical show, the best I would had ever seen ever see, because of the good publicity you made gave yourself in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong! Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later as than I expected! If the spectacle show has had been beautiful, I would have been quite pleased happy to wait. Then, I had read that there would have been be discounts available, but it that wasn't true! So it's It's better not to write anything if you don't make it isn't true then. Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change of to the programme: the starring star ! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. Finished After the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this hasn't hadn't been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it was had been closed: the chef went away left after he received a phone call! For all these reason reasons, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon! A suggestion? Organize Organise better your shows your shows better and do not exagerate exaggerate with publicity! Yours sincerely,",3.3,0102_2000_6
"There would could be many things to say about this. Technology is a wide field which increases expands very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I must can say whether technology has changed our life in a positive way or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we can make a phone call with an astonish astonishing rapidity, instead whereas at in my grandparents' time it took one month or more to have get in contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When appeared the first car the first car appeared, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else he they wants want ! What can I say about the television? It allows us to keep maintain connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which happened have happened or will happen. In, the not very far distant, 1914, parent parents sent their sons in to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible! Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress caused has caused some damages damage at to the community, not only phisically physically. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power. We became have become passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed. I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him himself known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality. Finally, everyone should decrease slow down his own life's rythm rhythm.",3.3,0102_2000_6

When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not none was available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it I would cost pay what they said asked. I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous irritable because I dislike very much very much dislike the impuntuality lateness, but that was not all. When the show started the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and he the replacement seemed not didn't seem to be an actor. Really he was bad.

"I think technology has changed my life and the way of living way of life of almost all people everyone around the world. First of all, technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too. Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - are have been making doing different things. For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by internet Internet or by telephone. I can know find out what is happening in differents different parts of the world in a few minutes. A very good point aspect of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job work because before we reaching reached had the technology they have had to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven ovens. In my case Personally I dislike computers. I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier. On the other hand what will happen with to us in the future? Our life lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs at work. So, what are we going to do? Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing losing green places and there are is a lot of pollution, so we have to be careful.",3.3,0102_2000_6

I think that, the big ' improve improvement development ' of technology in the last 30 years helped has helped and is still helping us a lot in our daily life. With T.V TV we can learn, what is going on all over the world. With the telephones, the aeroplanes, and even the fast ships, there are no big distances any more. Eve Every summer I'm going I go with my family abroad abroad with my family. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer ( and the internet Internet ) I can speak with to my friends, as far wherever they are. All these this may be sounds sound great, but they it aren't isn't all. With a lot of using Using of the T.V TV and computer, make makes people more close closed. You might not know your neighbour because all the time your you are in the house you are in the house all the time. Children are not studying as much as they have ought to, because they are watching T.V TV, speacing speaking talking on the phone or even playing computer games.

"17 May 2000 Dear Sir or Mam Madam, Last weak week, I went to London to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". I was realy really happy to see be seeing the ""Best Musical Show"" in London. But what I saw was exactly the opposite to what I expected. In other words, it was a disaster. Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts avaivable available ? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent different actors to those advertised which who were not very good in at acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed. It wasn't realy really a perfect evening like as you promised on your flyer. I was very disapointed disappointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was. Yours faithfully, Franz Morell Hand",4.1,0102_2000_6
"How has modern technology changed your daily life? Unfortunately, modern technology made has made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone no one had an opertunity opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity opportunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever wherever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into onto the Internet to get any information you need. Every production Production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for the worker workers anymore. Every thing Everything is controlled and produced by machines. This also is is also a very big disatvantage disadvantage because many people are losing thier their jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they wath watch TV or play or work with on the Computer and don't see each other any more anymore because they don't have to.

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This feature trait didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself. He wasn't really wicked, he merely didn't understand when to keep his mouth shut, especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called so-called ""private life"" runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know. Well, some people just don't care, some are bothered and feel ill at ease. But a small drama can grow up out of proportion as children are very sensitive. There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to the childhood and the teenage years. We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human. According to me In my opinion what is more to regret regrettable is when now we full-growns grown-ups continue to act with this bad habit. The criticism critical spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets.

Technology allows us to have more time to for distractions leisure or to for other things we really like to do.

Pat obviously couldn't help being keep silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic scandal-mongering press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the the whole story! On Sunday all the english English press was were waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all an a invention hoax, they got so angry that they wrote on in every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!!",4.3,0102_2000_6
"To. Mr or Mrs Manager of Circle Theatre. Hi. My name is Taeron Jon. And I would like to inform you that something is not right and is unfair about your theatre. I recently had a week's holiday in London. During I my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly unfortunately I had a very disappointing evening. The advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines wee was totally untrue. Which so called ""Rip off"". First of all, you said Danny Brook is was in the play but a different actor was in the roll role. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason, I mean the main reason, which made me to go go was to see Danny Brook. Secondly, about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to the late start, it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out side outside for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing out side outside and I got a horrible cold for because of that. lastly Lastly, about the ticket. The advertisment saids said ' Discouts Discounts Available' but no way, I had to pad pay the full £ 20.00 and the restaurant was closed because of rebuilding or something. How ever However, the point that it I am trying to say make is that you just ruined my hoilday holiday. For me, It's not easy to have get a holiday and your play just blew my precious time away. Let me make it clear, you blew wasted my time and money. I don't thing think your play worth £ 20.00. Your advertisment advertisement was un fair unfair. As you are a manager, you have resposbillity responsibility for to justify justifying this problem. and I have a right to get a fair treatment as a costomer customer. So, therefore, I would like you to pay some money back. I am not asking for full payment but minimum at least 50% of that what it I paid for nothing but the disappoint disappointment. Thank you. Yours Taeron Jon",2.2,0102_2000_6

But I say fashion is Artistic insperation inspiration which is expressed by fabric and all sort sorts of material. In some way, fashion is combined with science as well.

Million A million kinds of fashion magazines and News paper newspaper newspapers tells tell you how much people are interested in fashion. What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuffs stuff. As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations inspirations that we get from all sort sorts of enviroment environment environments. Development of science Scientific developments produce new materials like water proof waterproof or fire proof fireproof fabrics. For example, Castum Costume of Astronuts Astronauts space suits. These days we are very intrested interested in space and the millenium millennium and things and many designers have showed shown millenium millennium looks recently. But we don't wear them.

I was very disapointed disappointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true. For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with who gave a very bad performance and had a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five forty-five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning. All these problems spoiled my evening and frustrated me, since I was expecting to see a good play, so I expect a full refund.

When I finished working work I had to hurry up rush because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. For my surprise To my surprise, when I arrived to at the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait a long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15! You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong inaccurate information. For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets with at a discounts discount, but when I went to buy it one your employees told me there were no discounts available. When the show was over I went to have dinner to in your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacked lacking of employees.

"Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in. Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily life lives had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished, looking at how our lifes lives are changing frenetically. We have hardly assimilated a one piece of new technology when it is replaced or modified by another. Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily life lives more comfortable and easier, but does it that means mean that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free-time free time. However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stopping non-stop race.

Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes moderner more modern so that you can not cannot walk in them anymore.

Of course I must tell you that the strongest main reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence. Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant just only to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me. As if that was not enough, he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't appear show up. Those were are the reasons for my asking for a refund of the £20 I paid. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours faithfully",3.3,0102_2000_6

I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us?

He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always on the search for in search of answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"".

Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me the chance to be more peaceful relaxed and I think it is essential. Although I am thankful to modern technology!",5.1,0102_2000_6

"Dear Sir/Madam, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show ""Over The Rainbow."" "". Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided. Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written said said that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written said said that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing seeing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late. As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have ""a perfect evening"" as it was written said said, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose think it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back. Yours Sincerely sincerely faithfully,",5.3,0102_2000_6

I was first at first, very excited to see be seeing the show, because on in the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I can could have a perfect evening at there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening. I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started late later then than I expected. It should be run from 7,30 7.30 p.m., but it was started from at 8.15 p.m.! I want to complain about the ticket. On In the advertisement it said that discounts are were availble available, but when I asked a staff member of staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went to the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed early earlier than usual. I think they should keep the times correctly. I am very disappointed with everything what that happened last week. I would like a refund. I excpect expect this will be possible. Yours faithfully,",3.2,0102_2000_6

One of them is in the fashion area area of fashion. people People think that we will wear a simple, practical, light clothes. For instance, we can see that kind of clothes in sci-fi films like Starwars. however However, in the other hand on the other hand, there is a different idea. People like designer's clothes like Armani, Chanel.. and so on. They prefer new original style in order to show them make them look more attractive. Moreover, most designers prefer to use natural material. They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things rather than chemical one. In my opinion, people want to wear special and original clothes to show their own characters. Also countless fashion fashions will be shown seen.

This will willpower is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance of to meet meeting someone anyone who could help him. But I don't think he would want to. He doen't doesn't want help because he wants to prove to the little boy and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big age lived many years. I think this these are the reasons of for his will willpower. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself.

"Fashion of the Future. What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in the future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100. Of course, those these new material materials won't be so harmful for to our health as today's nylon and other things like that. On the other hand, people tend to wear natural clothes today, made of cotton, wool etc. This tendency may result in turning down rejecting synthetics at all completely. And it is even more difficul difficult to predict how what the clothes of in the future will look like. People's fantasy imaginations is are enormous.

These days, new designs and new trends are coming out every day, sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days when we were young. However, It it doesn't seem to take long for most of young people to get used to it, so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future. In my opinion, I believe that clothes indicate the individual's creativity as well as social situation. We never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age. On the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre prefer to wear nothing. Let's face it. Clothes are always changing.

"How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point sense that all everything I do is becoming more comfortable easier. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search for something like a telefonnumber telephone number or an adress address I also look it up from on the internet Internet. I use also also use the internet Internet when I need any informations information, for example if I need them some information for school or private privately, for myself. A few years ago I had to go in to a library and look it things up in many books. Most that That took a long time. I think the advantage of modern technology is that all everything I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbys hobbies or for friends. Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sounds sound better and the pictures on TV are being impoved improved, because the machines become more better better. And also a good intention for me is the Handy mobile, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people.",3.1,0102_2000_6

I had really expected looked forward to the show because it was the first time I had seen it in London and I was attracted by your advertisement which looked very exciting. However, I found it very disappointing. Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes on in the my seat, so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not the actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all. Finally, to make matters worse, your restaurant had already closed after finishing the show so I could not eat anything. You mentioned that ""Your perfect evening out!"" in your advert. but it was not absolutely absolutely not true! So I must insist that I want to have a full refund.

Amaisingly Amazingly, we can find that computer users are getting more and more there are more and more computer users. So the life is much faster and more convenient than before. My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computer computers or mordern modern technology.

The advertisement outside the theatre explained described a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring role ; you have had written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had joined attended the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you have had changed the program programme. Moreover the advertisement said that the show time time of the show was 19.30; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the whole full ticket's price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of in the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner. So it was not ""my perfect evening out"" and because of my disappointment I am here writing to ask you for some money back.",3.2,0102_2000_6

Because of my ""isolation"" the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet Internet so study to study or do researches research, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city without a cellular phone because it is too far and she is gets worried.

"At first First you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology'. For me modern technology are is things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, Hifi hi-fi sound systems, television or even cars. But are they are usefull useful in every situation and everywhere? My oppinion opinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour hours before training, I start a half half an hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The One finds the same problem with mobile phones, if I got get have one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I have got the Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body everybody should use the his saved time the time he has saved for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots. We should also move our body and not only use our brain.",4.3,0102_2000_6

"MODERN TECHNOLOGY ""Technology"" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me. From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings human beings to develop positively and negatively. Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc. were had civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering had mastered most of the science fields fields of science we deal with today. Back in the 30's 30s the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies. The military Military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments equipment we use were was originally created by those people. The fast and growing computer industry is giving leaving us less and less physical work due to a mechanical concept. Biotechnology is providing us with the latested latest discoveries to heal or improve the human body to maintain it at its most efficient state. Transport means Means of transport are also part of the overall technology technological advancement and allow us to go faster, and further than before with less effort. Besides all those improvements and confort comfort comforts I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us.

"As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes rootly radically through over the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be like 100 years from now In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn change to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing dress will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe wish without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns changes to be become stricher stricter and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing dress will indicate their position in society too. This is how what I think the fashion of the future will be like. The most exciting thing about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange, just as we don't think about ours are.",3.3,0102_2000_6

I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second, I can save time. If there was no public transport like the underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time. On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres computers or telephones I could have less chances opportunities to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a the car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit. To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient convenient. In spite of its good sides, I think my life could get worse.

"Nowadays In recent years, mordern technology has increasingly been developing been developing increasingly. We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily daily lives, on the other hands on the other hand, we get also also get many disadvantages which could harm us. In my opinion, the main advantage is the developing development of medical technology. For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off, the new medical technology could rebuilit rebuild part of your body. Another advantage is sharing information. The more developing developed the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is. So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country countries. In contrast, the technology can cause a pollution. By developing of transport, we can get wherever you we want to go easily, however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog. Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera camera cameras which has have been combined with mordern modern technology.

"I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affected affect any every aspect of my daily life. Looking back in to the past, I can see, how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so far much as we could can now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now, at present days in the present day. They could not communicate with someone living in other another country, often located far away from his their own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or the internet Internet, we have a better access to a lot of different news information. So, we are in a better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared in last recent years. For example, a lot of pollution has raised been created. We now breathe worse air in our lungs, then than our grand-parents grandparents breathed. I think, we are more addicted to do doing some things, which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watch watching TV or often using the mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe, that we are the a part of wildlife nature.

Will they still do the same 100 years later from now ? In my opinion, I think In my opinion, clothes will be a lot differente different in 100 years years' later compare to now time. As new New materials are will be made invented and new styles are will be created either by designers or people themselves, which leads lead will lead to changes in fashion, but on the other hand in addition come materials will probably still be used such as jeans denim, which was invented ages ago in America. and And people nowadays still use jeans denim as a common material. If you walk out on to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with of jeans denim, which is incredibly surprising! From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular. As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings clothing to show off their figure, They they might as well just wear clothes that are see through see-through to give it a better effect ! so So if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year years later from now, the only thing you can do is to WAIT!",4.1,0102_2000_6

Secondly, I coudn't couldn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later late. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill. I am therefore asking for a complete refund of my ticket and I hope you will improve the quality of your services in the future. Yours faithfully H. Coulez",4.3,0102_2000_6

So when he heard at random by chance that my parents were planning to offer give me a trip to San Fansisco as a present for my birthday, my little brother ran in into my bedroom wherever where I was studying and whispered in my ear the wonderful news the wonderful news in my ear. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a place seat on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for already one month one month already.",4.3,0102_2000_6

"I shall have a look into at the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen. How much effort and time it took about two decades go ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make even even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices made have made our life easier like as old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if your you forgot have forgotten to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itself itself off if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.",5.2,0102_2000_6

In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't.

Then the show already actually started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show. For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring star Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of in your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which who acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook. After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize realised that it was closed because the cook was ill.

"Fashion in 100 years If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredably incredibly big difference differences between them. People have become more informal, casual and practical than before. But how about the fashion of the future, for example, 100 years from now? I think it'll also be very different from now. But in which what way? First of all, people might think more about the function of clothes than the design. For example, they'll wear a cloth clothing which protect protects themselves them from air pollution, sunshine etc. Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes mouths and noses like we have sun-glasses, and that all the masks are designers designer brands, which are made of a special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air. It's like a joke, but a bit scarely scary. Imagine that all the people have hats with big broad edges brims to protect their faces from the sun-burn sunburn sun, and it's the most trendy trendiest fashion of the year! It's funny.

That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hack hacking into the school software. I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned scheduled to do. Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the ""crime"" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests.

"It's a good question, because I never had never have asked it to myself have never asked myself it. I think modern technology is changing so much my daily life my daily life so much and also is changing the life lives of others like me. Before modern technologies arrived, you can't couldn't comunicate communicate as easy easily as today we can do we can do today. An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can discover find more information than I can in a newspaper, and also information of from all around the world, that which possibly never I can could I could never possibly access without the Internet. But, it is not only news or information. You can comunicate communicate with people from in place places were where you would never can imagine to have a trip going to because it will would be too expensive. An extract example could be the popular chats chat rooms, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like to use using the keyboard to tell say something or comunicate communicate to communicate, you can use video conference conferencing, a sistem system wich which lets you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also there is the possibility of potential download to download things to your pc PC like software, pictures and, also, music. The modern technologies make me mean I am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can wear carry this music to everywere everywhere. Also computers and mobile phones had have evolutioned evolved thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we would probably still get be on in the ancient times. Who wants to return to the ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TV's TVs, no phones, no PC's PCs.. I'm afraid that the people on in the ancient times lived although they don't didn't have anything any of these things, but me and everyone of in this these times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to return to this life. As well Also, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that they are so expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down it is because anything something new is at the moment for available sell to sell. Is It is like a round tour circle.",2.2,0102_2000_6

"I am going to write about how has modern technology modern technology has changed our daily life. First of all, I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions of in human history and that without it we couldn't be where we are wright right now. One of the best examples is the car: in a lot of cities around the world, cars can be seen in the streets all day long. During the last decade the number of people who has have a particular their own car has increased increased very fast quickly. On the other hand people who hasn't haven't any cars, can also be helped by technology: they can use the public transport like the train or the bus, which is are also a comfortable form forms of travelling. But if you want a the fastest means of transport, the plane is the perfect one ! But technology can also help you at home if you use modern machines for cleaning to clean your house, clothes or dishes. Apart from that, technology also helps in hospitals. Every All the time there are more machines help helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tascs tasks. In contrast, technology is very bad for the nature environment : if we use cars we contaminate the environment, and many cars are being used every day! On balance I think that evidently technology technology evidently has got more advantages than disadvantages.",2.3T,0102_2000_6

But as it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct right at all, or I must have been to the wrong show! According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later late ! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned mentioned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing! The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing. I was a little hungry after the show, but then again, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information given. In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it. Yours sincerely",4.3,0102_2000_6

Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill until she had repeated repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with about her: she could would do anything to have friends, even betray me. No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. ""He's travelling around the world, "" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But I know knew Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man. Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same.

"TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES Technology is the thing that makes our life easy. Technology is in every part of our life. We use cars, trains, ships or planes when we want to go somewhere. But if they weren't made, we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey. With the help of technology, we do our works work in less time. For example ;, in the past, people used horses to go to another place. And their life passed in the ways. But now we use planes to go to far away places. It takes less time than going by horse. And computers, are the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day by playing with computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their works work. They connect communicate with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes into on the computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of note books notebooks and they also had to find places to hide them. But it has also also has bad points. For example ;, wars. Using technology, scientists make lots of powerful guns. It is bad for the world's world piece peace.

"In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life greatly significantly. To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box. When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it with using the phone. On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb my time me, the phone annoys me. Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention. With the internet Internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad. Since I bought a computer, I have been checking for E-mails from my friend almost every day. Finding them, I feel happy even if there is only one.

"In these These days, young people prefer wearing shabby and scruffy clothes to wearing neat and tidy clothes. In other words, their fashion has become more casual.

When they were young, they judged the other another person by his appearance. They also were were also asked to wear clothes which was were in accordance with the occasion. In my opinion, this is still correct. However, people noticed have noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind. If someone doesn't have enough knowledge know much about the event which he attends is attending, even if he wears clothes neatly neat smart smart clothes, he doesn't look like a gentleman.

So the main point purpose of my visit had dissappeared disappeared failed. Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later late.

"Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past, now and also in the future. However, things re are recycling recycled from time to time. So do the objective of wearing clothes. I will imagine imagine that, people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past. The people People in the past wear wore clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind. On the other hand, the people in the future will propably probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is are the result product of a developed and full-grown country. I think people in the future will likely probably to wear wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided. It is because of the increasing number size of the population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere.

"'Fashion of the future, ' I think after 100 years, at least something will change in the point that as regards design, material, color colour, etc. If I pick up the an example, the Kimono ( Japanese traditional traditional Japanese cloth clothing ) will wear be worn on in not only not only in Japan but also in another other countries in generally general. Also it will be only wear but its design, shape might take in casual cloth. If it came true, imagination to make cloth would bigger and could think various design and format. By Through one country's traditional cloth clothing taking in those of another country, it can born different type and new kind of fashion. On the other hand, there might vanish the personality (character) of each country the personality (character) of each country might vanish.

I am a great admirer of the actor Danny Brook, who was supposed to be starring in the musical. Surprizingly Surprisingly there was a complete completely different actor starring. Very disappointing! According to your advertisement the musical was supposed to start at 19:30. For some unknown reason it did not start until 20:15. I was looking forward to take taking benefit advantage from of the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available.

Indeed it was not a perfect evening out. Therefore I think the least I can ask from you is to give me the money back for the ticket. Sven Reitgard",5.1,0102_2000_6

"Fashion of the Future If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in spend their money on most, most of them would answer 'clothes'. In these days These days, new fashions have been passing pass by very quickly. From my point of view In my opinion, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin. For example, short skirts and tops like an under-wear underwear. I think young people would wear smaller clothes which make they them look like they are almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick. It could be happened that people wear will wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves. Next, I predict about patterns of clothes. The animal-pattern is catching up on now. It might be possible that the fish-pattern come up catch on will catch on in 100 years. However, fashion changes too fast to predict. I think fashion changes very quickly so that people are interested in those changes.",3.3,0102_2000_6

"In my opinion, modern technology changed has changed our daily life tremendously. First of all it changed our life-style lifestyle. For example, ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TV TVs. Because the people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobil mobile and can spend their free-time free time more aktiv active actively - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more open for the world. Secondely Secondly, we can do our jobs today more efficient efficiently. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our partner partners clients faster and better and offer them better service services. The ordered Ordered goods can be deliver delivered in a shorter time by train trains, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more for in our daily life - for on better clothes, furniture, spare time. I am a fan for of modern technology.",3.1,0102_2000_6

Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains complaint I can might start with the actor - who was a different one to the one advertised, not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous marvellously, but him, I think he is a ""street actor"" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the. The Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that which drove me mad. I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for a discount ticket,. I could not get it, it was really unfair,. I paid the normal price. Also there was another problem,. I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not, it was closed because it has been was being refurbished and redecorated.

"Fashion Of the Future There have been are already a variety of fashion style styles nowadays. Some are in formal informal formal others are in casual. Especially in big cities such as London, New York and Tokyo, you can see a lot of people in various clothes, so I do not think there will be such big differences in the outlooking outlook appearance of clothes even 100 years from now. However, I think, there will be some diffences differences in the quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made, in with especially especially with swimming costumes and athletes' costumes for the Olympic Olympics. In addition, I think the earth will be warmer and warmer than now and 100 year years from now will be an Area of Space. So clothes for space will be necessary and clothes for warmer climates will be necessary. In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think, a better quality in of clothes will be created in every field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space. although Although the outlooking outlook appearance such as, shape and color colour will not be changed change so much in fashion.",3.3,0102_2000_6

I went to see the evening performance of your production of ""Over the Rainbow"" on saturday Saturday the 2nd of June. At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable available. I bought one of the most expensive tickets. Although the show was scheduled to start at 19.30h, it did not begin until 20.15h. To my greatest disappointement disappointment Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement. After the show I had to find found out that the theatre restaurant, that which had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party. Contrary to your advertisement I had no did not have a ""perfect evening out"" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket. faithfully yours....",5.2,0102_2000_6

"Dear sir or madam, My name is Molly Menbrook. I have seen your new musical, 'Over the rainbow'. I am sorry but I must admit it was a bit disappointing. I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant except but it wasn't open. I couldn't see anyone inside either. No one. The show it self itself was quite disappointing. The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors. I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical... Also you mentioned a discount. For tickets. Well no, I didn't get a discount! And the tickets were pretty expensive... Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with the hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in. Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the runner manager of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him. So you see my point. It wasn't very pleasant. So I am going to ask for a refund... I hope this isn't affending offending you too much... Or asking you for too much.

"I think the clothes in future will be similar in shape as the clothes that exist now. Just like sweaters, shoes, t-shirts etc... But maybe not. When it comes down to color colour, I think it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery. Like shiny and plastic kind. Maybe silver and gold, glittery red, purple and blue. As well as bright yellow, orange and green. All suitable for discos! Shoes will be high heeled and modern. Colors Colours to match the clothes. Still, comfortable. I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens. But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick in of them!

There were a couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made a fool of my self myself by arriving late and had to suffer all those people starring staring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are were not available but on the notice board, it said that they are were available.

"Well, for instance people in Roman times (Roman soldiers) didn't have any sort of transport to move them from one place to another. The only way they could move was using their feet. They could walk over 4 km per day without any breaks. But people in nowadays like me can't even walk 1 km. And also what is the point of walking when you have cars and buses or even bikes. Phones also affected my daily routine. If I wanted to find one of my friends, I had to run around our hood neighbourhood finding looking for him but now, I just have to phone him on his mobile phone and just ask him where he is. Computers changed my daily routine because, when I was younger, I was spending spent most of my days outside playing basketball but now, I just play on the computers all day. E-mails are also one of my examples. When e-mails didn't exist, I was writing wrote letters and it took longer to get to the person I am was writing to but with e-mails, the person could receive my message within a few seconds and you don't have to count in how many days it will take before he will receive it.

Last year I spent ten hours looking for information for my homework. The subject was ""What's happening in Irak?"" I started my research in the town's library and all the information I collected was from a local newspaper. After two hours I thought that all of this information was writted written from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion. I used my computer for collecting to collect reports from the internet Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analize analyse it in two weeks.

You can find there all you need all you need there and more! I can't imagine my parents playing in the street, without watching the TV. I couldn't life live without modern music. I'm not interested in films without special effects.. And what about mobile telephones?

I loved and respected him very much, but there was an unpleasant thing about him - he talked too much. My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising to for her, because she could hardly ever think of expect such a present. We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the holiday party probably even more impatiently, than Susie. But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret. He told her about the present as soon as he saw her. I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited, that he couldn't act in a different way. Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but her friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending.",5.2,0102_2000_6

If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want. It's very important but some times sometimes it is a wrong bad thing because the children can see it too. Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up. We can find information about the weather, and sports on our TV-text. On the other hand, the science is changing. We have more researchers than some a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution of to lots of problems.

When I read the advertisement first first read the advertisement, I thought that it would be fun. In the advertisement, it was written wrote said that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing. The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15. Which which means meant, I had to wait there for 45 minutes. And also, it was written wrote said that the discounts were available but they were not. After the show, I decided to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. On the door, there was a note saying that the restaurant was closed because of the illness of the cook. I had given paid paid £20 and now, I would be pleased if you give would give some of my money back. It was a terrible evening out for me. I hope the next musical show would be will be a better one. Yours sincerely faithfully,",4.1,0102_2000_6
"MODERN TECHNOLOGY In the past, everything was very different. People had completely different life-styles lifestyles. People were using used candles to see around them. In winter, they used to fire burn some woods wood to keep warm,. ""Computer"" was a word that nobody had known knew the meaning of it. As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-and black and white. Their hobies hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything. Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We are using use mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or on in a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want.

"It is true that science and technology affects our lives a lot. The technology Technology is essencial essential to our life, we need it on each minute, on each second. It is rare the that schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to for the students use to use. But it this is good and bad in at the same time. Good because you can have acess access to a lot of informations information, and it is bad because the computers are getting doing the people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who have has the certain knowledge that the computers will not get take the place of the teachers? It is interesting to starts start to think about this point. Another point is that the television is taking the childhood of away from the children. For example, our parents had time to played play with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only shows show silly programmes. We need this technology, but we have to know how to control this it.",3.1,0102_2000_6
"Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show, which I saw last week. It didn't go on as I had expected and I was really let down disappointed when it finished. Firstly, it was meant to start at 19:30 a and I bought my ticket for the evening session performance. However, it began at 20:15. I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long. Second, instead of being starred starring by Danny Brook, the musical was starred starring by another actor, who I found really disappointing. Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show. I asked for about the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them. In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday. I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day of main the audience is largest. Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement said promised and that we all wished wanted turned out to be a regret regrettable for because of the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm including enclosing my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money. I'm looking forward to receiving your decision. Yours Faithfully,",5.1,0102_2000_6
"My daily life has changed quite a lot with modern technology. I live more comfortably and I am even more carefree than some a few years ago. I've been able to improve some things that could would have annoyed me some a little time while ago, and although they're mainly little changes they make me notice that my life is easier. At home, for example, my waking up alarm is no more longer a surrounding deafening sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program programme, set to start at seven o'clock. Then, when I was younger I would have to put the milk on the fire hob and wait until it was warm enough to drink. Nowadays, almost everybody have has a microwaves microwave oven, where you put your milk for less than two minuts minutes and it is ready to delight your mouth. Another thing are is the fifty-two steps which take me to the street. They have become as easy as calling the a lift, without making me feeling feel tired or even breathless, when I was am in a hurry. Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out until later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of the Internet and its arriving arrival to at a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want. In brief, my life is I am taking the most out of making the most of the discoveries in of science and technology and it can't be hidden I can't conceal that I'm really glad of that.",4.3,0102_2000_6

You will find always always find the same basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change. We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included. For example: a short, very classical and inside of it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find too some buttons some buttons too, to have provide.. fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe on your watch you would have a screen you would have a screen on your watch to watch your favorite favourite soap operas.

Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show which because it started forty-five minutes later late without any factual reason being given.

When this technological aspect changes so quickly, I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields. I would say that the worst thing of about this development for me is that more and more I experience I experience more and more stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is no not enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life passes is devoted in to my duties without leaving any time to for pleasures. Apart from this, another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities, being able to breath breathe fresh air several days a month when we go to the country. In addition to this, there is less comunication communication between members of my family, because when we arrive at home after an exhausted exhausting day racing with against the time, the only thing we want to do is lying lie in on the sofa while watching television. Apart from this, computer's advanced advanced computer technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to, while five years ago, when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters, which was a slower way to contact with people. On the other hand, and as a in conclusion, I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended surrounded by lots of gadgets with differents different functions.",4.1,0102_2000_6

I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appeared appear. He had been replaced by a really bad actor, of whom I don't even know the name. I was very disappoint disappointed of with that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actor actors. There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets, what which appeared to be wrong to too. I had to pay the full prize price for them, which was quite expencive expensive. My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play. It turned out to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even received receive an explaination explanation therefor therefore. I had a really bad evening and would like to ask you for my money back. Waiting for your reply Yours faithfully Pierre Gaussier",3.1,0102_2000_6
"In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First off of all, if computers haden't hadn't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of it one ! I use my computer for many things, such as homeworks homework, games, digital video or the Internet. The developpement development of portable communication systems, such as mobile phones, has greatly changed our way of life. It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen anytime, even if we are two thousand kilometers kilometres away from each other. Precision industry has changed my life a lot too. I practicate practise go Scuba Diving during the week-ends weekends and hollydays holidays. That wouldn't have been possible a century ago, because all our material equipment, such as dive diving computers, tanks or regulators, didn't existed exist at that time. I think that we live easier now (thanks to modern medicine) and that our lives will get easier with the time.",3.2,0102_2000_6

"I am writing what I think what the kind of clothes will people people will wear 100 years from now will be like. As we see, the clothes fashions are changing every hour. People are inventing new kinds of clothes and people are buying and wearing differents different clothes. It is difficult to say how people will be wearing clothes 100 years from now. In each country, each people wear wears differents different kinds of clothes, like for example, people in Brazil wear shorts, T-shirts or only go without them, ; in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes, if you analyse them from the point of view of someone who doesn't live in Saudi Arabia. I'm quite sure that people in all around the world will be wearing very differents different clothes in the future because people, especialy especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.",1.3,0102_2000_6

The modern technology which changed my daily life most is a the personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course works work in on the computer. The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations information in a shorter time. I can go on the internet Internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones. I don't have to go to the library and read hundred's hundreds of books to find informations information anymore. I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses news and I don't have to go to football pitches stadiums to see how the players are playing. There are, of course, some disadvantages. Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology. I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere. There are plenty of trains and buses. I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit. I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot.

"What will clothes be like 100 years from now? It is a very hard thing to predict. The fashion of in nowaday clothings clothing is just keep keeps on changing. Although some may appears appear again after a few years, different styles are developed. For Concerning the fashion of the future, I think it depends on the people's own personalities and they develope develop their own styles which suits suit them the most. They can wear different kinds of clothing, like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian Victorian time times and in different countries. For As for the colours, I think the metalic metallic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular. As different kinds of farbics fabrics will be invented & and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen. Maybe paper can also be a farbic fabric use used for make to make clothings clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday every day.

In fact it wasn't a realy real house, it was some stones between the trees in the littel little forest neear near our house. But we used to call it 'Our House'. It was a secret place and we had promissed promised each other not to tell anybody about it. Useally Usually we were cooking flower-soup flower soup, and talking swapping secrets.

"How has modern technology changed my daily life. ? A century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge plough behind them, we've got the word ""time"". Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no with no rush. In modern days Today we have to wear carry a mobile phone. I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner, I could see those busy people who are always on their way somewhere. I heard the different phone signals ringing tones, and, what a miracle, you can change them on the train when you are restless. A new word has appeared A new world has opened up in those days our times, ; a technical tangible proof of this is the computer. I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless infinite. In nearly every home you can find it one and the users now and in the future are the new generation. I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play, exspecially especially today when fuel is so expensive. Watch out how highly advanced highly-advanced technologies technology are can be appropriate and helpful for me and others, if we only remember the importance of taking time to be together.",2.2,0102_2000_6

I looked forward to a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had. Firstly, you did not tell the truth about the starring lead. The advertisement of for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook, unfortunately. Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor which who I do not like and if I have had known that he was going to be there I woud would not have come gone to see him. Secondly, it was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15. Forty five Forty-five minutes later! You also have had mentioned about the discounts and there were not any. Lastly, the restaurant which was going to be opened open was in fact closed without a reason being given ! Keeping in mind all these arguments complaints, I want to ask you for some money back.

"Contemporary modern Modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives. It is always with us: in our homes, in the places we work and learn. It affects our lifes lives, - my mine too. In fact, modern technology was already very popular and comonly commonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life rapidly suddenly. But I am also sure, that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me since from the very beging beginning of my day. For example, I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water, next. Next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the ideas results of the technology. On the other hand, I am aware of all these the disadvantages of the modern technology; pollution and the dangarous dangerous dangers it brings. But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary century - the age of modern science. Finally, I think that we cannot talk only about the changes which the modern technology has brought to our lives. That's because that I think that we are the one ones who change the technology as well. I think that our lives are lives with technology, they. They sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together. So how has the modern technology changed my daily life? I don't know how what it would be like without the technology.",4.2,0102_2000_6

My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes. I mean when the earth's Earth's getting warmer and warmer because of an the pollution that we people cause create in the world.

"I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot in with this these things. In music, before I having had a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into in my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I just can can just record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument, controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds. In graphic design, before I having had a computer I just could could just draw, but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel, develop ideas more easily, or take put photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them.

"Dear Sir, I am writting writing this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called ""Over the rainbow"" with my wife and children. We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one. First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people there came to see him. However, the man who took his place made gave a good performance, we enjoy enjoyed listening to him because his voice was amazing. The times time were was not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold. As it started later, it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take. Furthermore you did not apologise, as if it was usual! In my opinion, the tickets were a little bit expensive and not many people could afford the price. We did not see any discounts! Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came had been coming before. I understand them. After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place.

Modern technology is everywhere in our society. We use it daily and sometimes don't realize that things are changing in our daily life. The ways of we transport travel are improving a lot this times at present. The cars Cars are really useful and a lot more faster faster than waking walking or cycling. But cars created create pollution: for exemple example the green house greenhouse effect. But it is also the technology which try tries to resolve this problem with new way ways means of transport such as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities. Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences like medecine medicine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older longer. I think there is a link between technology and the sciences because they need each other: the sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches research in the sciences new research in the sciences possible. Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with the Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet Internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations information I need for my studies. In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary dictionary because it's faster and you really find what you need. Furthermore we can find everything all the time. Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could be also also be dangerous if we don't use it in the a good way.,3.2,0102_2000_6

Every day when I get up I am checking check if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS in on my mobile phone. They are very usefull useful things which sometimes are nessecary necessary to survive. Modern technology has got a big influence on our life. It is easier. We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones, which are the best things ever made. I use them very often in my daily life.

We can see PEOPLE'S LIFE in other countries, which is very interesting for me and my friends.

"Fashion of the Future. I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly totally different. In my apineon opinion the world by it self itself will be different in temperature cased caused by as a result of global warming, as well as also people will become more niceer nicer, less this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid made from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean green or gray grey. It They will be comfotable comfortable close clothes becaus because the main point for any caind kind of clothe clothing is to be comfatable comfortable. Also there will be no leather or fethers feathers used in maiking making these clothes becaus because by that time the population of animals animal population will foll fall have fallen and Green pease peace will be very strong community, much stronger and more pouful powerful than it is now.

May be Maybe they have will have more different types of colour colours than now. However, I think the style of fashion will not have don't think the fashion will have big differences because I believe that fashion is in a circle.

"To International Post magazine Application for the shopping trip to New York Dear Sir or Madam, Please find enclosed my thinking thoughts about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner way actually at present how the people are dressing people are dressing at present to see how it's going to be developped developed into in the future. Everyone has is his own style but it's obvious that many of us is are wearing the same clothes like as others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers short trousers and yesterday it was wearing broken-jeans broken jeans torn jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models, the medias media, or new collection collections, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive, that's which's why maybe maybe why not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people everyone will developp develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, in as a way to create their own clothes. In my opinion, I think that people will wear no not wear clothes anymore, just being be natural, being nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity their authenticity again. I wish hope that my article comes appears in your magazine. With Best regards.",3.1,0102_2000_6

It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away. To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed. The worst point thing was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood. Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I determined decided to fall out with her. Since then, I hasen't hasn't haven't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other another girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her since after we had quarrelled was: ""It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!""",5.3,0102_2000_6
"Dear Sir, A few days ago, as I was having a week's holiday in London, I read your advertisement, which convinced me to go to see your show: Over The Rainbow. I must tell you that this show was the worst one I had ever been to. First of all, I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who played performed were not the ones who were supposed to do be it there ! I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, as it was written in your ad! Another problem: there was no discount available! Finally, at the end of this very disappointing evening, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this latter was closed because of for a private party! To put it in a nutshell, contrary to what was explained described in the advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back. I look forwards to hearing from you",4.3,0102_2000_6
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it. Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten year old ten-year-old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret, for example. Thus when Sally explained to her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very embarassed embarrassed awkward. In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret. It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have prefered preferred not to know it. Pat was totally upset. She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her. Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, when went home, and locked herself in her bedroom. But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it.",4.3,0102_2000_6
"Dear Manager I'm writing to complain about the poor administrations administration of your theatre. Because, because the advertisement for the show and the real actual show were completely different. First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on in your advertisement but when I sat in my seat, a different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing for seeing to see them, as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages. In addition, when I entered into the theatre I couldn't have a discount in spite of being a student and I couldn't use in your restaurant either after the show. In At that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. It's It was nonsense, wasn't it? Anyway, it was not ""My perfect Evening out"" but I think that it was a kind of ""contract infringement"" so I would like to ask for my money back.

"How has modern technology changed our daily life? Of course, our life will be completely changed. However, we have to consider about our nature and human-being human being. First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now. All your stuffs stuff tasks will be performed by the computers. For example, if you watch ""The Star Trek"" - science fiction programme on TV, you will realise that you just can can just say ""Do it"" and then the computers will do it. However, there are some problems. If all your staffs are fulfilled by the computers, we might be idler than now. Moreover, we have to consider about our nature environment. As you know, even now, science and technology are destroying our environment, for example weird temperature etc. If we don't protect our environment, our daily life will not be convenient.

According to the advertisement, one of the actor actors who had to show would perform was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another, disappointing actor instead of him. By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it had was meant to start at 19:30: it wasn't in just late, it was to too much much too in late. We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for. And what's more, there weren't any discouts discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff.

Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that was borns born from the technology. Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have get further information about something that intersts interests you. But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind minds. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed change : in my mind all everything must be in order like in a the CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of the mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness consciously, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take make up part of my life. In the afternoon I stay spend two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in order rather than to meet meeting new people, to speak speaking with them and to have having being a in contact with the ""human world"".

At first First, I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor, but she must have been changed replaced since the actor was different. I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre. Nevertheless, I stayed since I had paid. I also want to put the stress emphasis on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm. It is was a really a shame! In fact, if I had knowned known, I would have probably stayed at home. We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available. Nonetheless, there were no discounts available at all. And, we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant in so far as because it was closed. Indeed, there was a little paper note on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness. Consequently I ask you for some money back, seeing that I think: it's not worth the bother to loose lose money for such a show., Thank you.",3.3,0102_2000_6
"I think that modern technology change changes my daily life. Indeed, daily life is easier thanks to technology.

On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we've got more and more possibilities opportunities to enjoy ourselves since she it invents a lot of products. But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes cheap expensive and I can't afford it them. In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it hadn't had never existed since there are too many things on the market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different marks makes. And it's all the more tyring tiring since you often wait during for two weeks before buying getting it. I'm bound to feel nervous tense.

So I entered to the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight (three quarters of an hour delayed late ). Then I got nervous irritable and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained to us the reasons why the show was late starting. Finally, when the musical started I realized that Danny Brook, my favourite actor, was not there. In your advertisement his name was in main big letters and in the musical the actor was different there was a different actor. After the show I decided to go to drink have a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete cigarette to try calm to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the free day day off for the barman barman's day off.

We have to say that technological searches advances have taken in given our society ""their good fruits"" but, at the same time, they have negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or ""green"" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize noise are the main problems of our society.

"'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life?' This is not a simple question because I got have been used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain to you how. I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In At that time I used the computer only to play with its video games. When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial essential to do doing my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job. One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered told us that the operation was a very simple one.

I could get her as well simmer to simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted started shouting uncontrollably: - ""Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat"", hurled Olga Olga hurled this at me, through down the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the ""poor cow""!",3.3,0102_2000_6

I had everythig everything planned, ; I and my family my family and I where were coming to whatch watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous disastrous. Firstly there was no available discount discount available, as though you said promised one on in your advertisement, so even my 6 year old 6-year-old son was charged the adult price. Then everything was going well untill until the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well. Well it didn't, it. It started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By by the way may I ask you how up to date up-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert advert saying the staring starring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other another actor and one I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment disappointment for my whole family, infact in fact. In fact all the viewers audience where were very dissappointed disappointed. Anyway the show was nowhere as nowhere near as good as it was mentioned meant to be and it was definately definitely worse than I had expected it to be,. I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes, desparately desperately searching for your restaurants restaurant, our stomaches stomachs rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do would you know ?, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems hesitation whatsoever. they They even gave us a table number. What kind of an organasation organisation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how dissappointed disappointed and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund. Thankyou Thank you for your time and attention.

Another bad thing about this school was that there where were different types of students that formed groups. Some where were just friend friendship groups but others took it seriously, maby maybe just a bit too seriously, they. They gave themselves names and acted as like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers members of other gang gangs, trying to start fights with them. This whent went on and on, got more and more serious, but it was so secret that the teachers didn't notice. One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly firmly to keep it a secret, especially from the other groups. But Pat was so exited excited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. and And the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyed annoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it., exept except a few phcyco psycho groups, some. Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannes meanness of it. That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exept except Pat, who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses where were working. Everyone was drunk and they simply would not let him go. Time was ticking away. he He new knew the attack was coming anyminute any minute. now, The time had come the.

"Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to ""the Circle Theatre"" looking forward to watching your musical ""Over the rainbow"". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-five forty-five minutes later late. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles trouble with buying a ticket before earlier : although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing to recognise to see that there was another actor playing his role. This actor was not almost nearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied paid so many much money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything else that had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced I to have have the right to get to some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)",4.2,0102_2000_6
"""The Old Man and the Sea"" I heard somebody say, ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had has caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none neither of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death life and death struggle. The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares bears everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping hold to of the line where on which the fish is on caught. The reader feels with for him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up. Although this situation might not be very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.",5.3,0102_2000_6

Miss Colston was an old woman, who wanted her pupils to understand and admire English novels and poems. But the children were bored during her lessons and Paul was very disappointed that she didn't read any funny stories. So he decided to scare the old woman away from school. Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it, as he was the best friend of Pat. ""Oh, that girl will cause some problems"" - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom. She approached the desk and wanted to open it, but suddenly Pat shouted - ""Miss Colston, please, don't do that. There's a frog"". The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - ""Who did it?"" ""Oh, God"" - thought Paul - ""the next time I will throw a frog inside into Pat's rucksack.""",5.3,0102_2000_6

"Dear Sir, I am writing to you because I have recently been at to your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening. I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment advertisement that there were some discounts available. I asked for about it but the answer I received was that there wasn't weren't any kind of discount discounts. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at the that moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed! I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to reply complain but there had been were only problems. I'd like not only to reply complain but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't ""perfect"" as you advertised but it was a big disaster. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,",4.1,0102_2000_6

Secondly, a lot of people were not very impressed with the time delay, because all of us at least have had to wait for almost an hour until before the show start started. Also, a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities, which said were said to be serve in an the advertisement. For example, the discount for the tickets were was not available, and especially in particular a lot of people were disappointed that they can not cannot couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgotten forgetting to clean up the mess from the previous party. Lastly, I think I could not call do not think I would call this as my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as a the Manager of London's newest theatre, you would will handle the situation favourbly favourably. Yours faithfully. Seung Phittikhun.",4.2,0102_2000_6

"DAILY LIFE - MODERN TECHNOLOGY MY My daily life. : I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do. I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost in on the Internet. etc. Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it in on a normal day, but when I sit and think, its it's everywhere! For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example for of modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at last least ! TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels. Now it's colourful colour and there are many channels on TV. You watch whichever you want. I can't don't think that I watch the same channels every day. A wonderful example for of modern technology: the Computer computer ! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most of the people. And the Internet. You can look for everything you want. You can talk to every all people living all around the world. You don't understand notice the time passing when you are in that world.

"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should be have been one of the stars, instead there was one a, for to me, totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start. Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there was were no discounts what so ever whatsoever and, finally, because of a shortage of staf staff, your restaurant was not available open for us. This event was not what I call : ""a perfect evening out"", as your advertisement promised. I feel entitled to compensation for this event. I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities responsibility. Yours faithfully Carolina Patharius",4.1,0102_2000_6

I have no idea from where to start I don't know where to start. The main character of the musical show, which who I'd like to say wasn't the ""BEST"", was awfull awful. His act acting was not good and he didn't seem like to like acting. Even my son could act better. After the horrible terrible act acting of your star, it comes the starting ours hours time. I was sitting and waiting for forty five forty-five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15, as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre, I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly unfortunately I didn't. Among all these On top of all this, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef chef and the waiters where were on holiday. You could hire other staff to do the work. I was very dissappointed disappointed, what else can I write what else can I say. It was suppose supposed to be my perfect everning evening out. But it wasn't. I will ask am asking for my money back. In Conclusion conclusion, I'd like to recoment recommend that you should, first, know what you have to offer and the then advertising advertise it. Yours sensirly sincerely Helena.",3.3,0102_2000_6

"Santigo, June 17th, 2000 Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the add ad on in the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was. One of the reason reasons I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor, announced in the add ad, to be Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with after forty five forty-five minutes minutes' delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The add ad also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason! It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket prize price, it. It is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for.

"We can hardly imagine life without compures computers, T.V. TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than the life our parents lived, thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of. The Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our life lives will be completely different in forty years.

"To For the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager: Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your show ""Over the rainbow"" and the conditions in which it is held performed. I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show. I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely really be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor. So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available such as those stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have take a seat and the show finally beginned began at 8:15! No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there... just only to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted repainted. To sum up, it was not the ""perfect evening out!"" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead). Looking forward to receiving your reply very soon. Yours faithfully,",5.2,0102_2000_6
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's what I learned from my own experience. We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets for from each other. At that time, I used to buy a lotery lottery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial substantial amount of money. I had to wait ten days before the lotery lottery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone. But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly smilingly and I find found out that I had many unsuspected friends... No Not longer long after, they were asking me to pay buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go going shopping, others to go going to the cinema and the a restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me. Endly Finally came the end of the week the end of the week came and I went to the lotery lottery office to check find out the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs for because many a lot of people had found had five numbers like me.

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I wish I had know known it two days ago... Exacly Exactly on On 15th June we were at the birthday party. Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him. I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea. I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin. It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing staring at us. Yesterday, I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony. I really regret that I was so foolish. The most horrible thing is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I don't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties.",4.3,0102_2000_6

I am really sorry to say that I am was very disappointed about with the whole organisation of the musical, starting from with the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An, an actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately, instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger unknown to me. Secondly, in the advertisement, the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre show started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional professional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets. There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock., and the musical finished at 11:30.

I was not satified satisfied with the show at all because it was very different from the information description your advertisement had stated given. First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation being given. Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner. I had planned to have dinner there after the show. What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time event during my holiday in London.

Instead of half past seven the show startet started at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have get a any refreshment because of for two reasons, the first one is that there was no information about how much time long the start of the show is was going to be late by. The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre theatre restaurant was closed because of building plans for the next two month for the next two months because of building plans. After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize realised that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into to the show, had been traded replaced by an other another actor, who couldn't sing as half as good well then as Brook. On your ticket tickets information is written out that discounts are available, when I ask asked at the ticket reception office I couldn't get any discount for beeng being a student. To make an result conclude, the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like the one promised. For these reasons I want to ask you to get for my money, of £25, back. reasently Miss. Winkler",4.1,0102_2000_6

"Dear Sir/Madam., My name is Veronika. And I visited your theatre to see a musical show, ""Over the Rainbow"". I am writing to you to say that it was a very disappointing evening. And I'll try to explain why. First of all, there were the different actors in a the show, but you didn't say anything about it before the show. The other point was the beginning of the show. It started at 20:15, but it was said that it starts would start at 19:30. As a result, I missed my train. The third problem was the discounts. There were no ay discount discounts at all. But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with the a discount. And the last disappointment was your restaurant after. After the show. It it was closed because of the lack of stuth staff. Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So as in a conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully. With the best wishes",3.3,0102_2000_6
"How has modern technology changed your daily life? We know that everything is changing. And of course the technology is also changing. Not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand, but now there re are a lot of machines to do the same. And it makes our life easier. Now we have free time to do anything something else, while the machine is doing our work. It's connected with our house, our workplace and e.t.c etc. For example, earlier before, I used to wash my clothes by hand, but now I have the last latest version of wash machine washing machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand. Earlier Before, it took me 3 hours, but now it is my free time and I can go for a walk with my friends. Another example is that earlier before we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy. Now we have a scanner and a printer to do it. And it takes bout about 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour. So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the it are really important for in our life lives things things that are really important in our lives.",4.1,0102_2000_6

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had already soon heard of about me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation. This was the kind of association everybody knew of about but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that telling talking aloud about the 'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards. I guess it was that thrill that actually made me anxious to know what really was going on inside the dodgy-looking old house guarded by a man with an unfriendly hound. I've always enjoyed the hazard danger and this time getting the password was, indeed, a tough coockie cookie. But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wonder wether whether to use it or not. Especially now, when 'big-mouth' Pat spread has spread the news to litterally literally everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me. Therefore, I have to escape. What I've learned from this situation is to never trust people again.

This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in with my studies, homeworks homework and projects for school. With the Internet, I got became more socialised sociable using the Relay Chat clients, but also got developed a kind of boredom, which is known as ""Internet Freak Disease""! I use it a lot, so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands. Moreover, fishing was has been affected by the modern technology. Fishing is my hobby and that's why I bought these plastic worms and fish, that are not so good - it's better to use alive live worms! To sum up, my life is surrounded by modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It only just depends of on your judgement and the way you're you plan about to use technology.",3.2,0102_2000_6

Certainly it this will be is easier and faster than write writing, but it was nice when you were waiting for a letter. Nowadays, you have get all things everything immediatly immediately and soon, but will it always be a good thing ? I think no not. Everyone have has to use modern technology carefully, because too much technology could be dangerous. It couldn't could allow prevent us from to think thinking and to do doing acting freely. Today there are children that who don't know nothing anything about nature and its things. Probably, because their parents haven't enough time to go out leave the city and show them nature.

Yes, but we mustn't loose lose the our values and or our free time freedom to stay be with our family families.",1.3,0102_2000_6

"How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main adventage advantage is that, it provides you with all the informations information that you need. For example, you have to write an Essay about the 2-nd 2nd world war. You get into on to the internet Internet and you're looking for those facts and informations information which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Further more Furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly unfortunately this advantage fact has especially especially has changed my life. Playing the games takes me up a lot of time and it became has become a bad habit. I have no time for learning and for domestic works chores. On the other hand, playing games and using a computer wide widen widens my brain so, as you can see, this modern staft stuff has got many advantages and disadvantages. The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful either too. I have got a steady contact with my parents and friends. I have no problems with changing the time of a meeting because I can always phone. But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation. The modern technologies brought have brought to my life a lot of changes. It is even seen in the domestic works chores. For example, I've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons hardly by itself. My mother is happy and I am happier because I don't need to put make an effort to iron the clothes. I only press the button and everything is going done alright fine. These are the main reasons why I admit that technology has changed my life and other people's life. I admire the people who made those machines and I would like to give them the a tribute. They made my life better.",3.1,0102_2000_6

It seemed very attractive and the different informations information on the ad pushed me into going to it. Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars, Mr Smith, and I think that you've lied to such naive tourist tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part parts and we only had different, and pityful pitiful ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of by forty-five minutes. It is a shame!

"How modern technology changed your daily life! To begin with, I'd like to underline how the place importance of technology has increased since in a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the beginning of economic prosperity, many goods like TV TVs, washing-machine washing machine washing machines, etc. became cheaper and available more available. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone, with the developpment development of satellite communication, seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life? As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influence influences me is in through my work: the internet Internet has become such an incredible tool, I can make research about into everything I want, find informations information for lectures, for example, or exercices exercises. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge. Nevertheless, new technology has made me become more lazy. I spend a lot of my free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing on the computer. Maybe it will change me into a kind of self-centered self-centred person, a loner. But the positive way new technology have has changed my life is in the way I to communicate communicate. It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent. I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone. But we should not forget that it's they are only tools and should emphazise emphasise human relationships.",3.3,0102_2000_6
"Dear Mr Brown, I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I got was rather disappointed. First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. What That is quite not not quite true because when I asked for it one, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding, "" no No "". When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently contrary from to what the advertisement sign says, what which really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play. But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance of the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing from in contrast to what was said on the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stamped stuck on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"". So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and having given the reasons, I expect to be able to count with on your sense of responsability responsibility, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night. yours faithful faithfully,",4.2,0102_2000_6

Two weeks ago I enrolled in a group to help on building a stage for a concert of to be given by a famous singer star.

It was really awful and hard. I finished the day too extremely tired. However, the second day was less heavier heavy than the first one. We just worked in on building the stage and all those that sort of thing. Putting the instrument instruments in the right place, testing all the microphone microphones as well as the sound was the rest of the job.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable The best way to go shopping is when you think to think in advance about what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought. Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking. The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress pressure or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!! Recommendations? Wait for a sunny day, take a look into at your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping trip !",4.2,0100_2000_6

What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering to wander around and looking to look at everything. Having money and be being able to spend it in on anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in into an enjoyable moment experience. The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings sales but it they is are even worse as everybody want wants to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items. You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted want.

"I do agree with the opinion that shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays many young people like to do their shopping. But, isn't it a kind of entertaintment entertainment ? In the first place, I would like to point out that to go shopping does not always mean to buy something. A lot of people, especially women, go to do their shopping only for fan fun. In such a situation they are looking for something that they might buy. But, what about real shopping. ? I mean shopping with a real purpose. For example, emagine imagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate suit outfit. It's a real nightmare when you try to match everything: from the size, the colour to the sawings of the suit that is acceptable for everyone. On the other hand it is a great achievement for you when you buy the suit that is perfect for everyone. To sum up, I would like to say that shopping is enjoyable when you are going only for fan fun. But, when you want to buy something special it's a real nightmare.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to learn express their opinions about shopping they can might tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true don't suppose it is true. For example me, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I hadn't liked didn't like it. However, now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be, "" yes Yes, I like it"". When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go going to some stores and try trying on new clothes or shoes and search searching for their size and so on. They don't think about other kind kinds of shopping which are liked by themselves. Maybe they like shopping on the internet Internet or window shopping ; it doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping style styles on in the world. I am sure everybody prefer prefers likes one of them. In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there are is always some fun you can find have. You only need to discover what you like, and how you can have fun with shopping.",2.3,0100_2000_6

"First I would like to point out, that this it was a good idea to present our school in a short film. I think first of all we should film an english English lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information-boards information boards. I think it is also important to present a comercial commercial business english English lesson, maybe. Maybe the pupils could write ""offers and orders"" or enquiries on the blackboard. Next I would film a BWPM lesson. This subject teachs teaches the pupils how to make good presentations. They go get together in groups, then they prepare power point power-point presentations and at least finally they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers. It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake break. The smokers in the school yard, the buffett buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting in front of at their tables writing doing their homework. I think then we should film an informatic-lesson information-technology lesson. It would be funny to present show the computers, which are often overcharged, or and often the netserver is spinning. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing working in excel Excel or a word Word text, while the computers do not work or brake break down. I think that would be all for our video. In my opinion this these are the most interesting things in our school.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"After the discussion that we had in the english English class, I understood that a lot of people sometimes don't enjoy during the shopping. I can't understand these people because this situation never happen happens to me. By the way, usually the people that who don't like shopping are men or children. I think it is difficult to find a woman that who doesn't like shopping. But I have to admit that sometimes I don't really like shopping, above all when I'm tired or when I'm not in the right mood. In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become nervous irritable because I can't find anything. For me, the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations. For the first situation happen to me, when I'm hungry angry with somebody really close to me like my boyfriend or a component member of my family, so for relaxing to relax my mind I go to shopping and usually I enjoy it a lot. The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something for me as a preseant present for myself.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is an obsession for all of us. We all like going out to the shops, and spend spending hours, looking at all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us. But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you are going go with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women, and especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on any all kind kinds of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they are do not buying buy anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I spent have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except from for looking at them trying on diferent different clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's realy really annoying. Also, you have to be careful when you go for shopping with children. Children always ask for something and they want to have all they the toys which they see and that's not very enjoyable for the parents, because sometimes they spend more money, from the amount of money that than they have planned had planned.",4.2,0100_2000_6

First, first of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something. The only time that it is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday. For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live life here in Greece. The activities I would like mot most to do to do most are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say, that I am quite good in at climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my live life, so that is an activity I have to learn. Last but not least there are some things I would like to know: What kind of wheather weather do you have in California? Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me? And what about money? How much money Should should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many persons people are going to stay in each tent.

"Many people, especially women, love shopping. If you go to the centre of every any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat. But shopping is not always enjoyable. First of all because of the big great variety in the store. Very, very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport sports shoes to choose from, not no, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas Adidas or Fila. And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want. Another cause problem is that shops and stores are often overcrowded. Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people. And many people are in a hurry, so don't wonder be surprised if other people have not do not have the tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars trolleys. Of course there are a lot of other causes reasons why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause reason, which is very important for me, is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone no one has time for you to show help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me you, no one to talk to and noone no one to complaine complain to. That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little small stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine complain about.",4.1,0100_2000_6

All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides Also the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the their delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will would be amazing and wonderful. There are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, despite the artificial sunbathing. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is a good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments equipment that you owns own have. In addition, we can film the library, which possesses thousand of works. Books, books of on various interest subject subjects, with up-to-date facilities such as computers, the internet Internet, CD CDs and cassettes. We shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when if we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear Shakespeare. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better. Finally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim.",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Why can shopping be unenjoyable is it that shopping is sometimes unenjoyable ? First of all, it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for. Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment on anything they see. Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know. Women, in perticular particular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see. If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried tries on some clothes (usually several items ) but it's that's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths clothes she chooses can at least help when you being are bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance experience process. It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots an othe another pair. Shopping for me in my opinion is supposed to be a very fast quick experiance experience process. As soon as someone else is with you, it can become horrible!",4.3,0100_2000_6

My holiday starts on July 1st. For August I booked a journey trip to Greece with my wife. That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S. in July. I'm not quite really a young man and during the past recent years of my life I got became have become accostomed accustomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp. Swimming is an activity I do have done since I was a boy,. I still enjoy swimming, especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition competitions, that which means I do go swimming just for fun. The other activity I choose is Photography photography. Usually I take just just take holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art.... I think there are no more questions. I'm looking forward to seeing you. Yours",4.1,0100_2000_6

"To Whom It May Concern, I'd like to say thank you for choosing me and sending me the letter. I am extremely excited about the camp! For the camp, you need some information from me, don't you? Therefore I am going to write them it down. First, I'd like to travel on in July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on in August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible. Second, I prefer log cabins than to tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents. Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities. Because This is because I've started been surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing. Also, painting is one of my favorite favourite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint. Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions. I know everything is included and I don't need to pay anything, but in case should I bring some money should I bring some money in case or not?

First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I was were hired! Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our heart hearts was were bumping thumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do, so we started working. After working 30 minute minutes, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully! Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusands thousands of funs fans came in into this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert. During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved. Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteres posters as well. It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you were had been there with us!

"Dear Mrs Ryan, I am really surprised about the free journey trip to California, because I've never ever won anything before. My summer holidays last for two months, but I just only have time in July. In August I am going to work in an office, so there is not no possibility of to travel travelling away this that month. I would prefer the accommodation to stay in a log cabin. For one night it would not disturb bother me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable. At the Camp camp I would like to go sailing a lot. Once my family and I went to Greece and rent rented a sailing boat for three weeks. Because most of the work did my parents my parents did most of the work, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat. As the second activity I have chosen to make take photos. I'm used to I used be to be the photographer at the holidays with my family on family holidays and I know how a camera works. Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and how much money I should estimately approximately approximately how much money I should take with me. I just want to know, what I will have to pay for alone myself. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to discover a new type of landscape! Yours",3.3,0100_2000_6
"The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to in tune with my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found it you should take everything you like and go into the cabin fitting room. It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a the suitable right size if the one item you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity. After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly. At the end In the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are all the work worth worth all the work.",3.2,0100_2000_6

On the other hand I think I would rather not sleep in a tent because I had a bad experience once and I would like to try log cabins. although Although it wouldn't be a problem if I finally have had to sleep in a tent. Another point is that I have already chose chosen two activities that you asked me while I am at the camp and they are basketball and golf, they. They are the best activities for me because I think I am good at both and I used to play them before.

"Dear Kim, Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life, as. As you know, I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing! The concert was in the University university in the middle of the field and at the begining beginning when we arrived there weren't many people, only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound system and of course us, who had the job of serving drinks during the concert. We arrived quite soon early because we had to organise work out how we went were going to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in the appropiate appropriate place. I was very nervous because I'd never been in to a concert before and an hour before everything stated started the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't avoid help it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't belive believe it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began feeling to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such so exciting that the time ran went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream. Well I think I'm going to remember it all my life and I'm sure that if you had been there you would have enjoyed it very much. See you soon. Best wishes.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out from of different shops, try trying on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally go going back home with dozens of bags in your hands. However, there are a few moments times in which when you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it, or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because the shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other month's months. Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress on and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes. Anyway, apart from these two cases, shopping is always very amusing.",5.2,0100_2000_6
"13/06/00 Dear Helen Ryan I am really pleased to hear from you that I won first prize in the competition. It is the thing I really want. How Now I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter. First, I am afraid but I can travel only only travel in July. I've got a three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August. I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee. So July is the only month I can take part in your activities. Second, regarding accomodation accommodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer. And I love would love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely nature countryside in California for me to draw on my canvas. Let me ask a question about clothes and money. What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take. ? I am really looking forward to going there and to your reply. Yours faithfully Yun Sandra",3.2,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable I love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable. For example, any all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at on weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment. However, people can't have a good time even at on weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service. For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering annoying unless shops have facilities for them. Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping. Otherwise they can have lots of problem problems and it is difficult to live.",3.2,0100_2000_6

"Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you again. As you know, I helped out at a pop concert last month., and I must say it was fantastic. Let's start from the beginning. First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars. I had to iron them, and put them in order, so that the pop stars, who will sing sang at the concert, would look impressive. and handsome. The most exciting things happened later. I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful. I had a lot of things to do during the concert. I had to look after the tone that nothing goes wrong. That was very responsible demanding but fortunately I had help from other another person. I must say that being in at a concert is very nice. But helping in at a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all your you need is co-operation and you don't mustn't think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon.

I have given a questionnaire to other students of in my class to know their preferences about regarding this choise choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is Philosophy philosophy. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in at explaing explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the sports-activities sports activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life school life and can be useful to see show and check out the moviments movements of the bodys bodies during the atletics-school athletics-school athletics school games events school athletics events.

Well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it. The concert was a huge success, lots. Lots of people came and enjoyed the music. I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially, especially when the musicians arrived, they. They can be very demanding people and sometimes they came come up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get. My tasks were very especifics specific specific. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and weir and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning fully functioning I moved on to work in the back stage backstage. I really enjoyed working with those people, they. They are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes. However, what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing, jumping and enjoying frenetically of something that I had been part of and helped to make it happened happen. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best Wishes",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a privelage privilege to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of ""the Rolling Stones""! I did various things for them. At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made. Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turning turn the volume up and down following to the musician's instruction. My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get jelous jealous. This was the best experience. I could give the members ""Shiatsu massage"" just before the concert to make them relax!!

The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about with this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts numbers of people. There were 963 persons people in at the "" Armaggedon Armageddon "" that night! But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence sense of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other another way to meet the ""New Bentley"" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one when I shared a meal with Paul McPartney.

You always find more shops and they are open even more late later. You can't live without shopping but shopping is not always enjoyable. Firstly, if you try to do your shopping during the rush hour, it could be very difficult. Everybody is stressed, you. You have to make join the queue. It is not comfortable pleasant at all. In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices. You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price. But sometimes Sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality. And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality. Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you. In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find. Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant. You could try to do your shopping via the Internet.

"13th June, 2000 Shopping is not always enjoyable. I think this topic is so exciting in from the antropological anthropological and psicological psychological point of view, because we can studie study the subject's reaction reactions before, during and after to shopping. People in general have a compulsory compulsion actitud for shopping to shop, in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for being to buy bought is not really necessary. We must to accept accept that the media have so an important effect in on our life lives, in special especially the T.V. For the men and women is important the appearance appearance is important and they spent spend a lot of money in buy buying clothes, cosmetic cosmetics, accesories accessories, jewels jewellery etc. And the other times they choose sometimes sometimes choose just for the label. Without give really importance to the calidad quality in. In reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area, because people in general they don't spent spend the time for prepare preparing food and when they go shopping they choose pre-prepared food. We know it is more easy easier for these those with a busy life. In the other hand On the other hand the facilities for access to the mall center shopping center is are not good. The area for parking, space for play grown to the children children to play or bus station near the mall is are not really appropiate appropriate adequate. Otherwise shopping will would be more enjoyable. I think in the nearly near future we need to decide with the goverment government. which is special place in the town we will be lefet left just for as a comerical commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket, and mall centre, in from different areas of the city.",3.1,0100_2000_6

My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that it is better to join do one sport and one ""soft leisure"" and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I don't know am unfamiliar with for during my holidays. Please could you tell me about the weather, if I need special clothes and about the money for the change how to change my money, if you don't mind. ? See you soon!

If You you decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a ""shopping destination"", that is mean means that you need something special for you yourself or someone else.

Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion looks on yourself you ! and And after that you can make a stop in visit the Duty-free duty-free shops and buy some chipper cheap souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with enough money to buy that what you always wanted to.

I was terribly attacked by a been bear and it still gives me nightmares! As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh new sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating fascinating to challenge the waves. I wish I could learn more to be better so that I could enjoy it more in the future.

That It was a pop concert of by Steps in the M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean. A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether whether everything is was going well according to the timetable, if. If something comes up, she should inform the other staff. I was then taken in on to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time times on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to the other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so though they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though thought before at first. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on going quite well. I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change changed their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking making jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying "" thank-you thank you "" to the staff. Indeed, they can not cannot succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know learn how they work behind the scene scenes. All in all, it was a once-a-lifetime once-in-a-lifetime experience. Yours,",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Nowadays most of the people are atractted attracted by to shopping centers, which is are not always enjoyable. So, I have some opinions to about this, which I would like to tell. First of all, I think people have to be careful in about the things that they buy because probably are not a good quality, this which is very annoyed annoying. Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and don't not spend it in on the thing things that they don't need, because by the end of the month they won't have any money. Finally I think the product products of the shops shops' products are in a good quality and reasonable reasonably price priced, but sometimes the staff of the shop shop's staff is not very friendly with to you,.

"Although shopping is one of the most popular ways to reduce your stress, this is not always the case. There are some negative points that I would like to make about shopping. First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is looking look around all the shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't not find ones any !! That's That would be so exhausting. Next thing you have to do is trying try them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms. After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted ill-fitting clothes, taking off and putting on. That's a hell!! That's not the end of the story. You need to go home with bulky bags in both of your hands!! To sum up, although there is certainly a good side of to shopping, such as the pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for a long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.",5.3,0100_2000_6
"Dear Sirs, I cannot express how happy I was reading your letter about the prize I won and about 2 wonderful weeks I am going to spend at Camp California in the USA. With regard to your questions. First of all, I would be very happy if you could arrange my trip and stay at the camp for July. I will still be at school in June, and I am going to spend the whole of August on a training camp with my club. July is really the only available time I have. If possible, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin. I spend spent 3 weeks in a tent last year and it wasn't the best experience of my life. I would like to avoid tents if possible. You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train in it in August as well - I don't want to loose lose touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still on at a beginner level. It seems like a good oportunity opportunity to practice practise it. Finally, I would appreciate it if you could send me some information about the weather in California at this time of year. I am a little concerned about the clothes that I should take. Does it rain a lot there? Another thing is money. How much money do you think I should take with me? Will you arrange a place where I could keep the money secure safe during my stay at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you and I can't wait going to go to the USA. Yours sincerely,",5.1,0100_2000_6
"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" In my humble opinion, shopping is one of he the most stressful and boring activities people do in life. If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on an everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere on at the top of the list. If it would be were possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me. First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it's its own idea of where it want's wants to go) between other desperate people people's baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or a some toothpaste. Especially that as it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores store. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludes concludes ends in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that? No. Most definitely, shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many, nicer ones.",5.2,0100_2000_6
"Dear Mrs. Ryan, I was very pleased to learn that I had won the first prize in your competition! To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only on in July, as it is the only moment time when I can take my holidays. I'd prefer to sleep in tents rather than log cabins: sleeping in tents seems to correspond to a ""spirit of adventure"" to me, what which I particularly like; in the opposite in contrast, log cabins are more ""traditional"" and a less interesting experience. I'm very interested in basketball and sailing, which are both team activities. As When I was a child, I was very good at basketball, even one of the best of in my class one of the best in my class even. I like playing in a team and deciding quickly what to do next. These reasons are why I'd also like to go sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospherical atmospheric conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need. I think thank you very much in advance for your kind assistance. Yours sincerely,",4.3,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make be a pleasure to for the buyer and, for that reason, will be enjoyable. But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try on. When you ask to, the seller sales person offen often answers that your size is missing out of stock. Hopeful Hopefully, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller sales person for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time The moment you realise it that, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for in the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick quickly as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest!",4.2,0100_2000_6

"Normally I enjoy really much shopping really enjoy shopping. In fact when I don't feel very happy I decide to do go shopping to try to cher cheer myself up. And really, it works. But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate it when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like it when I have to try on differents different sizes because the small size doesn't fit on my body me because I have got put on weight. It is in at this moment when really I realiase realise I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling. I think women, in general, are very impulsive when purchasing things. Many times we buy things that, in fact actually, we don't need and, sometimes you are surprise surprised when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down on your expenses for 2 months.

"'Shopping is not always enjoyable.' Is it true or not? Generally, women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who are keen on finding stuffs stuff which are is good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowdy crowded shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting. For the women, too. If they can't find things which they expected, they go there just only to get tired.

And, especially the practical work. It would be great if we show showed it these in our film, it. It might be also also be very interesting to watch it.

It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstars pop stars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs leftovers ! It was so fun, that and I enjoyed it a lot. If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me, I'm in!!! Write back soon",5.1,0100_2000_6

In answer to your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm hobby and I sleep in tents every time I go camping.

I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will. Will I get any tuition? Finally, I should like to ask some questions.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Our lives are getting better and better, so people began have begun to go shopping more frequently. It's always a great job treat to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us any good apart from the temporary satisfaction? Everyone likes sale sales, but those so-called sale items are not really of good value. In the fashion industry, sale sales begins begin at the end of each season and just lasts last a short time, because those owners retailers want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get gets out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in invested a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under the influence of these tricks. The result, is we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated expected we expected, or even suffer from financial difficulty. Shopping does not just effect affect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like really likes to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they? Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out realise it won't be always always be enjoyable.",5.2,0100_2000_6

My job was to leave some leaflets on in shops, restaurants and on the streets. Working with this band was an experience I will never forget. What I really enjoyed was been being part of the staff.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailors retailers are opening to customer. Therefore, people used usually to go shopping weekly or monthly. In my opinion, women are really enjoying really enjoy shopping. It seems a human activity during their spare time. However, we are going to change from the traditional system to the ""e-shopping"". It is new for customers by with. With technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it looks like a service and is also boring for the customer. I think most of gentlemen men dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time after for women finish to finish their shopping. I believed believe that most of busy people want go to go shopping by the easy and quick quick and easy way. Because, because they don't like waiting for payment and waste wasting time of life. Therefore, they would like to use ""e-shopping"", which is getting better for their time. The life style lifestyle has change changed already from the past. Shopping is a common activity in their life. We must focus on the specific life style lifestyle, which will make us enjoyable happy. In conclusion, I believe that shopping only waste wastes time for human life. And you couldn't get back any more.",2.2,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjeyable enjoyable. If I had the possibility choice, I would never go shopping to in the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can not can't find the items what that you want to buy. When I was at the supermarket last week, I suddenly decided not buying to buy from a supermarket at all. First of all, you need a lot of time, because the market shop is so big. Secondly, you have a lot of choises choices and you do not know which one what to buy. Lastly, there is a recyling recycling problem, which many people do not care about. You buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish so much rubbish should go. For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend use water, although I should do it. I think I am too sensible. I'd I prefer to go to the markets which are open and outside street markets. So you You can ask about the qualities quality and prices and get immediately your an answers answer an answer immediately. In my opinion, small shops and the markets outsides outside street street markets should be supported, on. On the other hand, the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling recycling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.",3.3,0100_2000_6

As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like liked it and get got quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I we can could would be able and willing to help for with the concert in two weeks weeks' time in the concert hall. I immediately say said ""yes"" and also so did my friend. I really think thought it sounds sounded so interesting. I have had never done light and sound for the a real pop concert before and I think thought it will would be a good experience for me. Actually I've I'd just done light and sound in for a drama's drama day in at my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll it'd be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television. ? The preperation preparation days came. The On the first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs job are is was preparing to prepare for the concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing amazing ! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have had to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, light lights, sound, and background. I felt like I'm I was one of those professional professionals too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing things from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like are ? It was good fun though!, but But my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed enjoy it as much as I do did. At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the those professionals. I really do hope I can be like them.

"Dear Kim In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert. The job came unexpectedly as my friend, who was supposed to work there, broke her leg just two days before the event. So she asked me to fill her position. Even though I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend. The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment refreshments for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them. When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands their hands full with fainted teenage girls teenage girls who had fainted. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint fainted, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted unconscious. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view sight of crying and shaking but absolutely completely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor. However, I manage managed to listen to the music and I must admit that I liked it. I actually injoyed enjoyed it working there and I wouldn't hesitate to work there again.

"I completely agree with the following statement: ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" From my point of view In my opinion a lot of people believe that it's very great fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true, but in my opinion go going shopping can be stressing stressful and disgusting. First of all, we usually go to the shops at the same time than as the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled full and it's impossible to try acurately accurately. Secondly you have to thank think before you come in enter a shop if you're going to have any luck. I mean that you have to wait until the seller shop assistant came comes to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy. Thirdly you have to pray you to find find the right size and once you've got it you have to think Does it fits fit me?, ""Does it fit me?"" And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a big large amount of money or you will end up stressed, disgusted, and depressed. At last but not at least Last but not least let me give you some advice, try not to go with that friend of yours that who is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will would be awful.",4.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Helen Ryan ; : Thank you very much for your letter and for this competition. First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available on in July, is. Is it that fine okay for you?

"Dear Mr. Ryan: I am writing in connection with the information requested, concerning the two-week trip I have won in the competition. Firstly, I was asked the time when my trip would be and I have come to a the conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this that very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go. About Regarding accomodation accommodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in a tents tent as I believe that is the right type of accomodation accommodation for going camping ?. Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot. I actually have much a lot of resistance stamina and balance so that will help me in both activities. Now, I would like to request some information about clothes and money. What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me? I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will helpful help towards the preparation for the weeks in subject question. Yours sincerely Gabriela Matos",4.3,0100_2000_6
"Right size, right colour Men tease women as for being shop-cravers shopping addicts and for having shopping as the nicest their favourite passtime pastime. However, that impression is not always true. Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however. However, do we really like the process of chosing choosing them? At times, it is not only the a matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill waste a lot of time and specially especially when your taste doesn't fit with the in in with the fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider it a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable?",5.1,0100_2000_6

The reasons as are the following ; : a tent promotes a better relationship with nature, and is a grate great opportunity to improve my health. Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to chose choose and why. I like swimming and photography because it will be very interesting to improve my skills at both activities. The last thing I would like to know is which what clothes do I have to take, even though the weathe weather in July will be good. Yours sincerely.",3.2,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable. Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but a few of us who is are very happy to spend money. Money is a very important thing in for shopping, if. If you have money, it is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagen imagine that your credit card is not working, or some one stold stole your cash from your pocket. We will say you're unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapt handicapped. Staying in a que queue or croude crowd is also unplesent unpleasant. All the people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need. After words Afterwards you are tiered tired and have no power energy to do things. After all the things that I have mentioned it is clearly clear seen that shopping is not enjoyable.",2.3,0100_2000_6

Just because Because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July. This, this, that is the month that best suits me. The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip. I would rather sleep in a log cabin. I find think it will be much more comfortable than a tent. The leisure activities sound fantastic, especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I've joined I joined a climbing group club in my town for 2 years ago and have reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience on of it but I wish want I'd learn to learn a lot. However, there are some questions that I want to ask you about. Do I need a passport to travel?

"This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily life daily-life video at school. The activities suggested are write written below. The opening time of the school, recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in, could be a good begining beginning. It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning. Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and speaking either theory lessons or practice would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons. Why don't we include some sports, for example, voleyball volleyball ? The team has been training very hard during the last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being at in the video. The musical music lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of from all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video. I think that if we mix lessons with sport sports activities the combination will give us complete success.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Most people enjoy shopping. But not me. I think shopping is hard, exhausting work, especially when you are trying to buy yourself some new clothes. The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff thing for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you. Eventually, after long seeking searching you find a skirt you like. But it doesn't fit. You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one. And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams. And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop. Accident An accident like that can really make you livid. At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town. You phone your friend to visit you and your friend come comes, wearing the a skirt not unlike the one you have just bought. But that's the life. You can always go and buy a new one.",5.2,0100_2000_6

You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the hi-fi system on the left side (it should be have been on the other side). Before his opening, the pop star found noticed the mistake, otherwise. Otherwise it would be have been a disaster. The performer, Paul, is a big music name at the present. But I'd never met seen him before. This time, I saw him in person. I told him I loved his songs, he. He was very happy. Then, we stroke have had a lovely conversation. Afterwards, he gave me his pen for my enthusiasm. Anyway, how are you? Write soon, tell. Tell me how you're getting on in your new job.

This report is based on a sample of over 80 students of my school. Favorite Favourite lessons Interestingly, over half of the students who were asked enjoy attending history class, while 30 per cent are keen to take an art and music class, and a small number of the student (less than 15 per cent) like to take social studies class. Favorite Favourite activities Not surprisingly, football was well-preferred as an activity which students do after school generally (over 30 per cent) and also about 25 per cent preferred baseball. Amazingly, over 20 per cent of the students would like to take up handball from next year.

"Hello! Dear Madam My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition. Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office for to get some work experience. I hope, that's possible. I would prefer living staying in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is more natural. A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp camping holiday. It sounds like a summer-holiday summer holiday at on the beach coast of Italy. From the activities you've offered I want to take to do Golf and Surfing golf and surfing. Both activities I've never done in my life I've never done either in my life, so I am a complete beginner in at playing Golf and in at Surfing golf and at surfing. But the reason I want to try these two activities are is their image. Golf play the is played by wealthy people, the upper class of a town a town's upper class, and surfing sounds like freedom. There is only one more question I want to ask: Can can I take my girl-friend girlfriend with me, of course, with paying paying, of course ? I hope all my wishes are realizeable realisable.

"In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a the shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only only to pay for a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good item a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy to buy nothing something !",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything. But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see it see it again, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time. And sometimes the credit card cashpoint machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of on your credit card. Another bad thing is that people want something some things very badly, and they can't afford it them. That makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy theirselves themselves.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people not don't. If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times sometimes you can do not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy are enjoying themselves a lot. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for For example if you are a working mother with three children, that which means you are always n in a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping shop in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue. You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it is very crowded and you spend more time thank than you prefer would like to. In Conclusion conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy busy. Otherwise If if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood. You should avoid the peak times.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Dear Helen Ryan I am replying in response of the competition I won. As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the travel trip. First of all, I would like to travel on in July, because, during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for other exams or I will be out away travelling somewhere else with my relatives. I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in a tents tent, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. For Regarding the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activitie activity that I have never done before, which is Sailing,. so I am a totally total begginer beginner at this. The other activitie activity is Photography,. I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera, all. All I want is to improve my knowledge. Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many clothes I should pack. Is there any place that where I can wash my clothes? I also needed need some information on about the money I will should take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all? I will be waiting for a reply.

"Dear Kim, I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything. But now I found have found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped. There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was ""Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking with and helping the most famous pop bands!"" I was so excited that I couldn't believe it. When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice with to me that it seemed we had known each others other in for ages! They weren't those the kind of people that think they're gods. I helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars guitars ! That was so great! I don't know exactly how I felt, sometimes. Sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream. I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an you answer reply as soon as possible.

Could you tell me what are the weather conditions in California the weather conditions in California are at that time of year, because I want to know what clothes to take.

"First I would like to say that doing making a video about daily life at our school is a great idea. Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there. I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic. To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film. Below are my suggestions of for what should be filmed. The first thing to be filmed is our English lesson, because our teacher Mr. S. has a lot of weird ideas and we could get a lot of fun moments on tape. The chemistry lesson should be filmed because we do a lot of interesting experiments there. The computer class can could be also there, because program programming and internet surfing is are quite interesting. As for other activities, there is a Jiu-Jitsu class after regular lessons. Martial arts are realy really exciting and are a great thing to film.",4.2,0100_2000_6

I In the end he make makes his drems dreams coom come tru true, he get gets catches a vast Marlin. In thise this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it can might be deficult difficult and take a long time but we can do it.

"Many people ""see"" at shopping like as an amusement, but I think it's not always a good translation to give it. In my opinion to do shopping is often funny fun, above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shop a shop without difficulties. For exemple example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because they will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of leaving wasting time. Shopping is a funny fun thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have some free time and when you can relax yourself. Another thing that regardes regards occurs to me, is that I enjoy my self myself more when I know I have to do go shopping for me myself than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!!",3.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems. The first thing is the place location of shopping the shops. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping. The third thing is the trouble of full shops crowds. Everybody do does their shopping at the same moment time and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying to pay for those things. People are often nervous irritable and agressive aggressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women. There is one more thing. When you are a man and your wife asks you to come go for shopping, be patient!

"Going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it has also also has many disavantages disadvantages. First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are on week-end weekend. Streets The streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want. Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had have to find a particular item of cloth clothing for a precise special day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it. However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what else to do. You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant fun to try on many different types of clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny fun ! Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible. For instance, if you try on a an item of cloth clothing which fits you well, it can contribute to make making you feel better.",4.2,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. I would like to begin this composition by saying that, not for everyone is shopping the same shopping is not the same for everyone. For some people it's great fun, but for some other others it's a "" must necessity "". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As, as long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become becomes a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping shopping with someone else, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting boring. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys does the their shopping alone.

We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to in the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging to hang the decorations.

"I hate shopping but in the other hand on the other hand sometimes you can have fun at doing it. In my opinion, it dependes depends on your mood, your financial ability situation, off course of course, where you are going to do go shopping and what you are going to buy. Usualy Usually people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you are tide tired, you had a row with your boss but you are still going to do go shopping. And what do you have. ? There are huge queus queues to the tills, noise, hussle hassle, poor custumer customer service. You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finaly finally when you got get home you think that shopping is not that as enjoyable as you thought. For example, a lot of people do not like to do go shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varaity variety varieties of products, different prices, different quality qualities. You should walk will have to walk miles around the store to find what you wanted want. Yes, there is a big plus for with a big store of course. You can find everything in one place, instead of in contrast to the small shops which is are specialised specialise on in one product. And people spend all weekends weekend walking around shopping cities centres and high streets in trills to buy something. Nower days Nowadays tecnical technical progress gets close to us, to usual normal custumers customers. The Internet is one of the issue issues solutions at to this problem. Without any hussle hassle, seating sitting in your chear chair in front of your computer, you in a second in a second you can get in to at any shop who that has an internet site, - most of the big companies have it one, - get all the information about the product, get a cheaper price and buy it.",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Our school, as it is well known, is a technical school and consequently the its daily life contains consists of different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, showed shown to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create for the video. The mathematical maths lessons are divided in two part parts : the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry the physics laboratory and the chemistry laboratory. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will be surely surely be enclosed included in the video.

"Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan, I'm writing about the competition you organised. I have just received a letter from you where you say I won the first prize in you competition. I'm very glad about that and I also want to ask you a few questions. I can only travel to California this July because then it I will be on my winter holidays. Before and after this period is impossible for me: I have classes and I also have to work. About the accommodation, I prefer to stay in tents. I have always dreamed about going camping and staying in a tent. Now my dream will finally come true. I think this way is better to keep in touch with the nature. I would like to do photografy photography and swimming. I love to take photos but I don't have any techinique technique. I would like to learn more about it. I have always swam swum and I can say I'm good on at it. I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need to take, if it's cold out there and about the money. How much money do you think I have to take to buy food and anything else I will need? Do you have any idea about how much we spend per day? I'm looking forward from to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Raquel Soares",5.1,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. Is It is a kind of relief for them. Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery jewellery, anything. Specially Especially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking at all the news new things in the stores. But, sometimes, go going shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect defect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers assistants don't treat us well sometimes. Sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should have... So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just go went shopping when you really need needed and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music. Remember: go going shopping is not always the better best choice. It can be very unpleasant sometimes.",4.2,0100_2000_6

"Although many people enjoy shopping, shopping is not always enjoyable. You can fall on come across a very disagreable disagreeable sellor seller shop assistant and if you find what you wanted, you will not want to pay him or her for it. Sometimes the seller assistant might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor seller assistant. For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two sellers assistants are talking and, although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor seller assistant. There is nothing more disagreable disagreeable than that. Also, when you find a nice sellor seller assistant and he shows you lots of objects, when then you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose waste his or her time, so you feel obliged to buy something. All this is to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not.",3.2,0100_2000_6

I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories, in which we could show a student making doing experimentations experimentation experiments. In order to strike impress people who will watch the film, we could record film a student drawing on the big drawing tables. I would do the same for thermodynamics. Nevertheless, we should not forget the extra-life extra-curricular life at school. We have to show sports at school and all the activities that we are offered. There It are is not only the brain which should be trained. Futur Future students could appreciate to come coming if they could still practise do their sport.

"Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video? Well, I've just polled some students and here are their responses. 70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because it is one of the lessons they enjoy the most. The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun. 60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video that they can also have fun at school. Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring. In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because it is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it. But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows how what breaks are like and what students do during them. In a nutchel nutshell I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed. Nuria Valverde.",3.2,0100_2000_6

For some people it may be a method way to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still have something you will not enjoy it. It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping. For example, some people always shopping shop to get food or stuff the they need in everyday life, they. They won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping is also very important.

Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find. I had once once had this problem. I was looking for a special fruit. The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice and or helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as like,,customer treat with order"". Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful. ! He wanted everything what that his eyes saw. All the stuff for children are is in on the same level as they have their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfy unsatisfied with the store.

CHEMISTRY: We do a lot of experiments and the materials we use are very good. I think that if we film that this class the people that watches watch it will be impress impressed with the equipment we have got. SPANISH: We are doing a play now. We could film it and produce it, instead. Instead of uniform uniforms we could wear costumes, the. The ones that who are animals could pain paint their faces.

"From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special good item you never find it. Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing looking at a wide variety of products, that make makes you feel confused, and you don't know which one item fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else. I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover Especially in the shops that sales sell fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that when it really become becomes tiring. To summarize, I could would say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then, go shopping. If not you don't shopping will never be enjoyable, but also only tiring and boring.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable, ' and who is happy only when he can go shopping. In the first First I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so it in a hurry or for as a duty. If you have to run from one shop to another and, always looking at the your watch, doing going shopping is a terrible activity. On the other hand if you can walk around without anytime any time problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable. For istance instance, it is funny fun enter to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt T-shirt although you do not buy anything. To sum up I enjoy wasting money and whether buying useful things or not. I often like getting buying gifts for my relatives and friends. In my opinion, shopping is relaxing, above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work working week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday.",3.3,0100_2000_6
"Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for the kind letter you have sent me. I am very pleased and very excited that I have won - I can't wait to go to the Camp! At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying. However, I will be free in July - but please not note that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California. For the accommodation, I would like to stay in tents as I have never slept in one before. It would also be a chance to try it out for the first time in my life. I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never took taken proper lessons. Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block? Lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet appropriate to take? Would there be a bank near the camp? Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, MIDORI FUYU",5.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter. You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes! Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groups group's instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as my many balloons as we can could and sprayed them with gold and silver. The concert went terrific terrifically, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having a the time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me! At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alread already left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night! Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it! Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck! Best wishes,",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Dear, Kim How are you? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I ever have have ever had. Last week I offered myself to help the others at the concert and it was amazing. I couldn't believed believe how close I was to the band. There were so many youngsters at the concert, but because I was the youngest in a the helping team so I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment. A The concert did went very well and I enjoyed it so much. Later on the band took a break for ten or fifteen minutes, so I served them with glasses of fizzy drink and chocolate bars, biscuits and sandwiches. You will not believe how close I was to the singers. After a the break, the bank band have had to carried carry on with the concert for another one hour and a half.

"Why do people like so much go shopping like to go shopping so much ? In my opinion the majority of the people that who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind kinds of things for her their family families, so, for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday every day and that drive drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money. Othrewise Otherwise On the other hand, there are people who think the opposite ;, such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy shopping hardly ever hardly ever go shopping, - only when they need clothes, or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as much funny fun as you want, although if you do it very often, it will be as an obligation in the future. To sum up, all everything you make do in small cuantities quantities is good and funny fun, but don't encrease increase them the amount you do if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.",3.3,0100_2000_6

They are very gentle nice. After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium, where they had played.

"Unconected Unconnected part of every all people people's lifes lives is shopping. We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are is money. As a teenager I must addmit admit that there is nothing more enjoyable from than shopping. It's like,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like you are flaing flying. Choosing gave gives me such big great pleasure because I never have to worry from about vere where do I take get money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I ought have to do is buy and choose. I think that,,having is a dream'' of for all of us. It's hard for me even to emagine imagine the a situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly badly and you can't have it. Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present. Everybody know knows that,,present presents a problem'' You know your own task taste but what vith with about a the task taste of the other person? However I can't agree with the opinion that,,Shopping is not always enjoyable'' I think that everybody like likes to buy but not everybody like likes to see take pleasure in it.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable More and more people like shopping now. You can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time, especially in Oxford Street. Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working express speed. But is it always enjoyable? Of course not. The most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy, you turn to the people who sell them, but they sometimes ignore you. So you like them but you don't want them any more. It makes you angry! Also, for example., you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tell tells you ""I'm sorry, this one is sold out""! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately. And sometimes, for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you were are a rich man it doesn't mater, but if you were are a poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable at in thoese this situation! So I think shopping is not always enjoyable!",3.2,0100_2000_6

I enjoy so much fashion fashion so much that my life change has changed completely since I start started to study clothes designer fashion design and I discover discovered that fabrics, and colors, are really enjoyable. But in this days these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, on at the end of the season it is half price,.

Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up at on a high street to go shopping.

I knew thought though that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway. I went back everyday every day just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money.

"Shopping can be very exciting and fun. The feeling of buying new things is wonderful. But it might not be the same everytime every time. We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying things neccessary necessary necessary things is fine I think. But buying things that you do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But after afterwards you never eat them and just bin them. I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you don't need or unplanned, might make you feel sad after sometime some time.",5.2,0100_2000_6

Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people), consisted in carrying music musical instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,... The job was hard, but, from my point of view, it was worthful worthwhile. I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun. Every five working hours, we had thirty-minutes thirty minutes' break to eat something. We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons. The most exhiting exciting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day there. That was fantactic fantastic !

It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it. First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs.

You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month? I must say that was a great fun,. I've I'd never had this kind of experience before.

"Introduction The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnair questionnaire conducted in the school and our English department's investigation. Lessons According to statistics based on the questionnair questionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker native-speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe English classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore, less fewer numbers of students were nodding off comparing compared with other classes like Maths. Consequently, it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere atmosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of the English department. Extra activities It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on at the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness keenness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed. Conclusion To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books bookworms but also enjoying our school life. It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of.",5.2,0100_2000_6

Now let me tell you about my sports preferances preferences. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us went came out from the water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am candidat candidate to applying to do a masters of in sports in water polo.

"In our lyceum school we have a listem system of ""double lessons"". It means that every day exept except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a ""double lesson"". I think that is more convinient convenient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty forty five forty-five minutes. It is convinient convenient, I mean ""double"" lessons, because you have more time to understand the matherial material what which is givven given out and because you have to prepare only four subjects for ""tomorrow"" and it is less fewer then seven subjects. As a student of in the economical economics form I think I should tell you about one day in the time table timetable of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have such these lessons : English, Math Maths, Economics and Phisics Physics. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them. Especially, especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists. Not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, Biology and Phisical Physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.",2.3T,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Many people enjoy going shoppings shopping, meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience. The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure, provided you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endure endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if these this were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse. Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience.",4.3,0100_2000_6

But why is shopping so popular and loved by so many people all over the world? Why so many people have been have so many people been contaged infected by this "" psychologic psychological virus""? The verb ""have"" is probably the most used and loved by the human species. We are always trying to have more things, that which in spite of care after lead us to neglect us our family, us our future, or and other things which are probably more important than a new perfum perfume. Always more More and more people, everywhere, are becoming shopping-addicts shopping addicts. Maybe you can think I am excessive exaggerating but recent studies prouves proves prove that this mania can be really dangerous.

"The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video from about my school. In my opinion, maths, politics, chinese Chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularlly particularly curious in about. As far as I know, English people are really surprised about at the Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as the their knowledge in of politics. This is a good oppertunate opportunity to see how they learn in class. As it is expected, painting lesson is an amazing one. You can find students use using traditional chinese Chinese ink to draw and write. In spite of As well as these lessons, there are all kind kinds of activities such as sports meeting meetings, racing competition competitions, and countryside activities. Some are held once a year and some are held every term. You will experience a different life in them.

For people who used to are used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and it they are always looking for fashioned-clothes fashionable clothes. But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like during the sales period, I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring. In my opinion, I think people have to do go shopping even though they don't appreciate like it very much. If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a the supermarket is full of people.

However, shopping sometimes make makes them stressfull stressful stressed. People often waste money for on unvaluable worthless things. Then, they really regret it.

It will be very nice for me. Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins,. I think I prefer like both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place,. I think I will choose log cabins, ; it's it they sounds sound good and if I have time, maybe I can go to stay in tents next time (maybe next year.) ).

"Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me. Me too. But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable. Firstly, I am a student,. I don't have a job, so, I have to asked ask for money from my parents. I can't asked ask for too much that's. That's very bad for my parents. When I go shopping., I alway always feel shame ashamed because I spend my parents parents' money. ( although Although I got have got a part-time job, it provides just enough to pay my rent.) Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things are always expensive. You should spend more money on buying clothes and food, you think you will be very happy when you buy shop it, but, when you come back home and take out you your purse, you must will be feel sad, you your. Your purse is nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money.) ). Sometimes, when you shopping shop on the street, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy it them once, then you will feel very sad maybe maybe you will feel very sad. And then, you may save money for the things you like, nothing to do, just for the poor things what you like so funny, isn't it? Another thing is when you shopping shop in on a busy street, seem like oxford st Oxford St in London., a lot of thief thieves are there, they. They will steal you your money, that's. That's so dangerous. So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me. It This will stop when I get a good job. Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it.",2.2,0100_2000_6

"'Shopping is not always enjoyable' If you have to go shopping again, because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes, a lot of time, patience and straingth strength are needed. All kinds of shopping have more and more become to a rather stressful activity stressful activity rather than an enjoyable on. I It often begins with finding a parking parking space for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes. Leaving the car at home is also not a good ideas idea as you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic-bags plastic bags. The next stressful factor begins in the shop :. Everywhere people who are in a hurry and push you from one side to the other. Consuming has become a very important thing for them. And if you are not quick enough they won't leave you anything left. But there occure occur also problems problems also occur if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive. Having finally decided and got what you wanted to, the next torture comes at the cash-desk cash desk, when you have to pay. You have to wait at in a long queue for more than 15 minutes.

There is joy in shopping when it is made done by ourselves to for ourselves. It That means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based in on our relationship relationships to with another other people, in the at work or in the family. So we have enjoyable fun when we buy what we like following according to another other people's views.

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I think this statement is true. In my opinion, shopping is not suitable for children whose age ages is are under 18! This is quite a strong opinion, but I know it from my real-life experiences of shopping. When I was 15, I was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything I could would find now unneccessary unnecessary. I'm I would not dare to culculate calculate how much I have spent for on those things without thinking. However, it was not bad, my. My mom mum always told me that I hadn't have earned enough money so that I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way. Therefore, people who is are over 18 can think of more reasons than young children can for shopping and buying such tempting objects. To sum up, shopping is not a wrong bad thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what why you are spending it for !",3.3,0100_2000_6

"There was a meeting to talk about a video about daily life at our school. It was thought that a normal, regular lesson, 3 optional lessons and a great deal of activities should be filmed. Refering Referring to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming. I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn. There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting, and photography should be included. It can show how much students are enjoying enjoy their life in our school. As well as that, if we filmed famous students and teachers in our school, it would be a fantastic video. In my opinion, students can learn English from wide activities as well as lessons. That's why they prefer to film a lot of activities.",4.1,0100_2000_6

"Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing describing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday, or Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance shop assistants can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that Above all, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things., such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament department store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands depends on us if whether shopping will be enjoyable or not.",3.3,0100_2000_6

Also there are plenty of dangerous dangers that since lots of people have their wallet stollen stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people. In addition, shop owner owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly secretly. The customer can never know what price is the normal one unless they have a the same shop or the same thing.

"Sometimes the bad charachters characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones. I completely agree with this statement. Recently I have red read a short story written by Agatha Christie. His Its title was: ""The Mistery Mystery of Hunter's Lodge"". The charachter character which whom I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering, the mistress. It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people two people at the same time : herself and the houskeeper housekeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it., I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him her orders. She was the head boss in this story. The plan was almost perfectly perfect and the police hadn't couldn't discovered have discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot. In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a an extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense. Moreover she must have had an ""ice blood"" and strong nerves to handle things in that way. As far as I am concerned I would appreciate to have having myself some of her characteristics some of her characteristics myself, like take a decision and handle.",3.2,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. However Although it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more, it. It is very fashionable those times. They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do. Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway. Is it enjoyable to walk around shops, looking at nice stuff things, without having enough money to spend on buy it them ? Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time rush hour or when it is very hot, in summer for instance? Enjoying shopping isn't the a reason for doing that it. I think people either go shopping to change mind to relax because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human being beings.",3.2,0100_2000_6

A good idea to start will be a clock alarm an alarm clock ringing close to his bed, because that's the way everyone get gets up in the morning, ( unless apart from the people who don't do anythink anything ). After that, we should have a morning view shot of one of the most busiest busiest London tube station stations in order to show stressed people going in and out, Including including among them our protagonist going out leaving peacefully with a couple of books on in his hand - then the school's door, and him going in. After all this introduction, it will be the time to show some of the acitivities activities every one everyone can join do in at the school, such as lesons lessons or others like the library, our protagonist having a cofe coffee with some coleagues colleagues in the cofe cafe bar, the reception service.. And finally a view shot of all the students leaving the school would be a nice end ending.",1.2,0100_2000_6

"Everyone has likes and dislikes. But noone no one is doing does what he likes all the time. There is are times that when you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times that when you are doing what you like but not at the time you would like it to. What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time. First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy to shop shopping all the time. Nothing in life is always enjoyable, not even the things we enjoy to do doing, and that's how life is. You say you enjoy shopping. I understand but life goes on you. You can't do the same things every day. live Live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do doing different things is exciting and more fun. You don't have to be bored with the same old things. Because as I said to do doing what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have a long time to do something the you enjoy it more.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"THE RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING Why do people like shopping? First The first answer is that they need to go shopping. Second The second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping. When I do go shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but only if it is possible to do the shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for. I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend, she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time. If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really a good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time. Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad a situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argument arguments with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashameful shameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because because she never managed to get me out from of the toy shop. As you see, shopping is not always enjoyable. Always make sure that it is the right time to go shopping.",4.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable I think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good about it. For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest most necessary things like bread and other things to eat. I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes. Also a problem while with the shopping is that most of the time there are so too many people and a lot of traffic in all the shopping-centres shopping centres. All the people are there most mostly on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities opportunities for shopping while during the week for the employees workers. I think one possibility alternative is to buy your things on the internet Internet, because then you have not don't have to invest a lot of time for buying all this these things, and they bring you the things at to your home. In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility chance to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.",4.1,0100_2000_6

"To: John Weller. From: Raquel Rossell. Re: Suggestions for the film. Introduction To make easier and faster this report this report easier and faster, it was necessary to make a questionarie questionnaire which was gave given out in the school. After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results: 1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the listening room room and the library because, as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places that helping help them the students to improve their English on their own. 2 - They also think, that through filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will be become interested on in knowing more about the school, because a few English schools have this sort of classes class. 3 - The least but not the last Last but not least, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activities extra-curricular activities organised by the social programme, has have became become really exciting, so. So they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those that who did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougth thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important. Conclusion As you can see, my clasemates classmates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have. Despite of there being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar. I do recommend to pay paying attention to the food in the cafeteria because, even though it was not the main reason subject of this report, they also wrote complaning complaining to complain about that it. If you need more information and or the sheets that I collected, please do not hesitate on asking to ask me for them.",4.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that's that give gives you more opportunity opportunities to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping, at least they say that they don't. Despite the fact that it I love shopping I have to agree that it is not ""always"" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's boring annoying. You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps shops are so busy because its it's so boring annoying. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas. Another point is that now you don't need to go out just for shopping. You can buy a lot of products by over the Internet. I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it. In conclusion I think there is are boring time times and enjoyable time times when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring time times.",3.3,0100_2000_6

I have played basketball during for 5 years in an amateur franchise team and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good.

"Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for on yourself or people you appreciate like is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare. You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys aisles to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price overpriced. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay stand up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital hypocritical cashier. Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but, unluckily unfortunately, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into in more frustration and tiredness. So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.",5.2,0100_2000_6

"Sometime Sometimes when you ask your friend, especially girls., What ""What would you like to do after the class or during the weekend? "" The the typical answer would be 'I'm going to the shop because I like it, even windows window shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it's wasting it wastes my time, especially when I can't find the thing I want, this. This is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all everything on your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought, which is are very heavy sometime sometimes.

"""Cry Freedom"" If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", from by John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice? Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid Apartheid apartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout without reading the book more than one time once. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries. However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, the love of justice, the fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as like the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes myths legends, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them. To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story.",5.1,0100_2000_6

Concerning the accomodation accommodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather... Since this stay at Camp California is a good occasion opportunity to discover try out new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner in at both activities. Then, I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need there, and if I have to bring a lot of money. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Richard Amelin",4.2,0100_2000_6
"Dear Kim, I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably now know, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert. What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons. The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met found success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions rehearsals, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: ""You know., I already know them,. I have even helped them at one of their concert concerts."" Moreover, the work I've had I had to do, apart from carrying material equipment, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend friends with some of them. Even though my entire body aches ( the material equipment was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it a work! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Richard Amelin",4.2,0100_2000_6
"Dear Helen, I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to reply and ask you some questions. Firstly, I would will be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, for regarding the accomodation accommodation, I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent while when I was joining staying in a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have choosen chosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite favourite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would like ask to ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial special clothes for camping or the camp will will the camp provide them for me.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree I do agree with this expression statement. One of the most unforgettable habit habits of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth clothes shops looking at the new arrival arrivals new-arrivals clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but it also decrease decreases the amount of money in my pocket. Sometime Sometimes shopping doesn't give do anything to for you but always only waste wastes all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time stay in a shopping center centre forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs complexes nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities facility inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping a balance between daily life and shopping life may give be more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex.",4.3,0100_2000_6

In fact, I really do not mind to stay staying in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before. I think its it might be fun to try to stay in the a tent this time. I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming. I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen. I won first prize two years ago. The other activity is swimming. I started to learnt learn when I was five years old. I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club. Now I own a swimming school and have trained train the staffs staff every week.

Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared prepare a stage, doing things like put putting the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do put on some make up make-up. I was very frightening frightened I might put too much make up make-up on their faces, but everything was allright all right. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for the staffs staff or the singers. After the concert finished I had to help them cleaned clean up everything. I was so tired, but enjoyed happy. I really like to help people without getting something back. This experience I was so prond proud of I was so proud of this experience and very enjoyed happy. I think I didn't waste I don't think I wasted my time at all. I spent my free time to helping them and its it's made it made my life a little bit busy. I think I have learnt a lot from this experience. To When helping people you should not expect anything back to you, except happiness and enjoyable enjoyment. Well, I think I must stop writing now.

"Dear Sir & Madam Thank you for your letter. I'm writing this letter to tell you some further information that you need. First of all, I'd like to travel in July because I have to work every month except that month. July is the only month that I can be free. I prefer staying in tents because it is an unusual experience for me. Also I'd like to have the chance to play tennis and try sailing at the camp. Talking about tennis, I used to play it for about five years when I was a child. I think I'm much better than a beginner. But I never had a chance to enjoy sailing. I'd like to try this time. Now, I have two questions about camping. First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough? I've never been to California, therefore please let me know about the weather there. Second, how much money to do I need? I haven't a clue about it. I'd like to know some examples. I'm waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely",3.3,0100_2000_6
"Dear Kim It was so nice to hear from you last time. Thank you very much. As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, the. The artist's name was ""Bonny Pink"", who is famous in my country. I could enjoy her music very much. My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was a most exciting job. Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite favourite artist and her hobby. I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing doing puzzle puzzles alone. She seemed to be a very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had a very gentle attitude when she spoke to me. I became a fan of her. It was a very interesting experience for me. I wish you were had been there. But don't worry Kim, I'll send you a copy of her CD for you. I hope you can enjoy it. Anyway it's the time to go to bed. Take care of yourself, Kim.

"From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me. I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like. The, the Sports Shop sports shop. You cannot lose waste the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is allways always what we want. That's men's intention. Another point is to go to a big area. Specially Especially, especially at week-ends weekends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to take get a license licence to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge que queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out. In conclusion, for me, to go shopping is not enjoyable at all.",4.2,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable If you are used to go going to the Shopping very often, maybe it is because you don't know about all the others other good things you can do on your weekend. People are used to go going to the shopping shopping centre because it is easier easy and familiare familiar, it. It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops. On the other hand, everything at the shopping shopping centre is more expensive, because the people that buy shop on it there usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place. Instand Instead of going to the theather theatre, which is more cultural, or even do have having a picnic on at the Ikurapiura park, people prefer spends spending all their money at Shoppings shopping centres. So, why don't we try to change our customs habits and start to do knew new things to enjoy ourselves.",3.3,0100_2000_6

When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters guitars. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought took me to a room. He explained to me that it was to controll control the light.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. My best friend is crazy about shopping. She will prefer prefers shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant way spending of of spending time, when you going go from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Somitimes Sometimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a sense of living reason for living. And it's there's there're so many people like her. Lots of families planing planning plan a day out to go to a shopping center centre, and it is a normal routine for them - to spent spend the all day just shopping. Not so many people thinking think about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more. They forgot have forgotten how beautiful could can be the countryside the countryside can be, and only tourists you can meet you can only meet tourists in the castles or museums. People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied tired. People are not smiling do not smile to at each other, not talking do not talk to each other at the shops. They look like a robotes robots who have to do their duties duty - to buy. In my opinion shopping is just something to cover our basic needs. Shops are not for spending our lifes lives in them. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends, going to play do something together. It feels much more better. You'll have happy memories and be in a good mood.",3.2,0100_2000_6

Secondly, my choise choice is the accommodation in tents,. I think it could be more interesting,. I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside, in. In my opinion if I choose the log cabins log cabin it will be like be being at home. About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one ones are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it,. I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago,. I felt really healthy. My other choise choice is painting,. I paint have been painting since I was ten years old,. I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class. A One thing I would like ask to ask is if I need special clothes,. I don't know what kind of camp I am going to. It should be a dry place, I think, but I would like to make sure my guess, as well.

"- Shopping is not always enjoyable - The most popular ""sport"" that all the people everyone do does it's is obiously obviously shopping. This is the thing that move moves hundred hundreds and hundreds of people in the world and we don't have to go to Japan, we have the evidences evidence here in England. But the question is: Is shopping always enjoyable? Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewells jewels jewellery, furnitures furniture, etc. and you could have a real really great time. But other people don't think like this, for. For example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion intention the girl get got lost. The mother was shock shocked, she. She didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in in and out the places, it. It was a nightmare but fortunaly fortunately the police found her. Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen imagine be being in Japan or China and have having to go to the shops? I don't thing think that I'll I'd enjoy it, all the people knicking kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy something anything, and. And also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops,. I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where we are are we going!! In my opinion shopping is not the a thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful, there are too many people in the shops, so I prefer spend to spend my free time go swimming or painting and I go shopping in on the days that when usually there are not too many people.",3.3,0100_2000_6

In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choice choices that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen, along with some questions. Firstly, I wish to travel on in July as I already have plans for June, which is are to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacations vacation commences. Secondly, to regarding the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much. Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing. I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort. However, as this will be my first time to go surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners. Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lie like to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of the amount of money I will have spend to spend in the camp.

"13 June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hi Kim. How are you? I am fine and so is my family. I was glad to receive your a letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could. I thin think it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band having putting on their concert. At first, they asked me to decorate the stage since I like drawing, but as I wanted to get more involved, they said that I could also help them set up the lights, the microphones and the instruments. I have to admit that it wasn't always easy, but my effort was worth every penny. The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well. I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together. I'm not sure of what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too. If you have any questions, please write to me.

"Dear Kim, I bet you want to know everything about my great experience at Luna Pop's concert last month. Before that I had never thought I would play with a famous group. But maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning. As you know, Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being to be accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band band's electrician. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all anyway because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play. In that moment Just then Ake exlaimed exclaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun to learn but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune. I think you can't believe I don't think you can believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience. This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed staying being on the stage with all those eyes on me. I wish you had been with me but I'm sure you understand what I felt. Love Mafalda",5.2,0100_2000_6

"A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men of in the world would never believe that in my opinion, shopping is really not always enjoyable. Eternal crowds, high prices, long hours of choosing a suitable thing, that is what shopping means to me. Especially In particular, I can't support bear to do go shopping with my mother: it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with her. When I am on my own, everything is fine: I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours to choose choosing what I really want either for myself or someone else. Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way of to do doing it. Some go just to kill the time kill time ; others - to look at something new,.

"I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantage disadvantages of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want. It isn't true. Nowdays Nowadays we have many big shopping centers centres. We like them because everything is on in one place. The most suitable time for shopping is the weekand weekend when parents don't work and children haven't got a school. Because of that, shopping centers centres are over crowded overcrowded. You can't buy something in a peacful peaceful and calm athmospher atmosphere. In addition, in such this kind of shops prizes prices are very high, of course not all of them. However such centers centres are very useful and necessary. I In my opinion the worst thing which may happened happen is an extremly extremely hugh huge long queu queue to for the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping could can be enjoyable. If you bought something goregous gorgeous, you would will be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have are in a bad mood don't go shopping.",3.2,0100_2000_6

The aim of this report is make to make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed.

"Shopping is not always enjouable enjoyable because of several factorors factors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive expensive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, ""If I had more money, I would buy it"", or ""I wish I had more money."" Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended to, the. The people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own on your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing think the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation situation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable unenjoyable.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Shoping Shopping is not always enjoyable. As a housewife I have a good idea about it. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go two days twice. We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable. Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not. I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday it is not the same. Shops The shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we got have to face a long queue in order to pay. Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people It is tiring for some people to spend long hours shopping. I find it very tiring sometimes. Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually much more money we spend we spend much more money than we expect. We can't do anything about is it. We have to face it - it has both sides. Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday every day.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"In my opinion the statement 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' is totally true. An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like. Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue pair of trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example. I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments sometimes you don't know what to say. In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in on some clothes that than you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping is being boring, I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes items of clothing and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.

"People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes. A man usually is is usually less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay for what his wife has bought. In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the contrary On the other hand, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when there it is a lot of crowd crowded. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend a an hour to buy buying some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other. The better best thing to do to skip avoid queues and crowd crowds is not to go shopping on Saturdays, but it is not always possible.",4.2,0100_2000_6

It sounds like foolish. However it often happen happens. Secondary Secondly, the customer's service often makes us angry. Of couse course, the shopkeepers are human being beings as well. But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines routines. So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy. I sometimes loose lose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly bad behaviers behaviour. Moreover, shopping is just a part of life style. It's necessary to buy something to alive live. We have to buy for some thing something. For example, for our jobs, supecial special ceremonys ceremonies, and so on. Even when the risk comes up with shopping. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable for us",2.3,0100_2000_6

"Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable because of for different reasons and places. In the first place, some housewifes housewives don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you realise you forget have forgotten to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore! Another point of view argument against shopping is a the lack of the items that you really want. Sometimes when you meet see a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no in your size left isn't one left in your size. I cannot imagine anything worse. The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card. When a the bill comes to £1000, you would will be shocked and regret what you had have done. In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently accidentally meet get into a bad situation or you can not cannot control your expenditure carefully.",5.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Helen Ryan, I have happily received your reply letter and I want to thank you for this marvelous marvellous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only period month of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks.

I would like to play basketball and tennis for you. I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good in at it.

"Dear Kim, How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up to onto the stage and, believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shoke shook our hands. I'll never wash my hands hand again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon. Basilio Romero",5.2,0100_2000_6

I have to tell you that for me it is only possible it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this that time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer a tents tent. For me tents are a kind of back to basic back-to-basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature. I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California. I've chosen singing and swimming. Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well. I'm also used to sing singing in front of a large number of people 'couse 'cause because I did have done it several times. I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional professionally. There are two further questions which I have to ask you. First How, how much money do I have to take with me? and And what clothes should I choose take ? I'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer this these questions.

"Dear Kim! Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered I'd entered I'd won a competition. I was so happy and suprised surprised that I first first I could not really believe it. But it was true. My price prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the their concert. The pop group which was going to act play is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) ). But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I It started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering, which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything I was not able to eat anything either. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding guided tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised realised that they are were very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they did gave a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like "" Did you like the performance ! ?"" or "" How What do you think about the first group? "" Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they. They were not conceited or something anything like this that. They were like any other person persons people and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days in of my life. Hope you answer this letter as soon as possible. Lots of hugs and kisses",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Well this is abosolutly absolutely true, espacially especially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed crowded, and most of the people are stressed, it's. It's crazy. For exemple example, you go into a cloth clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would will fit match their new skirt, so they are looking every where everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have it and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose have chosen. And you have to wait after that to buy it, so finally you waited have waited so long that you are getting have got have become late, so you get stressed to too. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus, most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids kids' names into in the shopping mall because they lost have lost them. So you are getting get a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if. If I can give you an some advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses bruises because of the woman that who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!",4.3,0100_2000_6

"I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropreaite appropriate time! Not only shops are are shops crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queue queues. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side of to 'shopping'. I, personally, enjoy shopping very much. I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them. I find that shopping is a very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath. I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future, there will be no more crowded streets because of the ' internet Internet, ' on which you can order onlines online. Maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future! We all just have to wait and see...",3.3,0100_2000_6

"12 Barcicka Str. 45-139 Warsaw 13 July 2000 Dear Ms Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter I received yestarday yesterday. I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At the beginning I would like to answer the questions you asked me in your letter. The most appropriate suitable month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off (I am in charge of a project which starts in June so I am sure I couldn't go later). 'As I have a choise choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins to rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended dependent on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in a photograher's photographer's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the cathegory category of,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started a few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familier familiar with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would like also also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is. I want to thank you ones once more for taking me into consideration in your competition. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Juliana Piotrowska",5.1,0100_2000_6
"Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking throug through shelves and not finding that in the end. What did you feel? You had to be disappointed. There is are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order broken. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time. Moreover, you could face an agressive aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager. This leads to an escalation of your anger. Sometimes you could find a bargain. You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price. But at home you noticed notice that there is a tear on the sleeve. And you couldn't of course give take it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee. You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money. Somebody could give you not enough change. How would you feel? Deceived? So if you don't want to feel deceived or offended, think twice before you decide to go shopping.

For most Most of the people might think, why would I say that, ? because shopping is a very good entertainment, especially for female females women, as like me.

It would help helps you keep up to the date. What With what with what fashion is hit in now. But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends. Then, then I can say I'm I definatly definitely doesn't don't feel any it is enjoyable. Because, because of the crowd crowds. For me I think, it is not shopping that is but a kind of suffering. Especially, especially, queue queuing up for twenty minutes for just paying to pay the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting to get your the right size of clothes.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping sounds very enjobleable enjoyable and is fantastic for women. You can find a lot of interesting things which you were unexpected. Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes. Nowadays, in a family, shopping isn't a women's woman's job. In other hand On the other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want wanted to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which when you are looking at some interesting things. It will would be very really awful. However, shopping has pros and cons, it. It depends on personal thinking taste. I enjoy shopping very much, it. It can let help me know what's going on in the world.

You have to try to park your cark car first, which and sometime sometimes the space car parks are fulled full and after you have parked your car and went gone got in into the supermarket the product you wanted have has run out so you have to changes change your plan for dinner or going go to another supermarket to facing face a long queue. that That make makes you whole day for shopping which was not fun at all.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"""Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not"" - my English teacher has asked me on in the class discussion about shopping. Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen of on being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores. Despite the fact that I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands, as prices are usually to too high, unfortunately, not affordable for me and out of my price range. Sometimes I go to the local market, but not on my own. I ask my husband or mother to come with me, as I had a bad experience in the past, when my bag with all my money was stolen. Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants assistants which try to sale sell any products product to the ""victim"" entring entering coming through the door. Otherwise shopping is not so bad, as you get what you want in the end.",4.3,0100_2000_6

For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I get am used to it them. Because I'm not good at sporting sport, so I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying in at the university I joined the Photo Club where I got the knowledge a as well as a wide variety of knowhow know-how in taking photo photos. As I love singing and always spend my free time in doing Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad. I also have a couple of things to ask you.

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to do go shopping a lot when I was in at the university. I was 19 years old but I spend spent over 200 pounds in some weeks just to make keep myself up-to-date fashionable all the time. I bought lots of new, fashion fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. Four For four years in at the university I never had any saving money savings. Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young, as mentioned so. So it I came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money. I found that it's not worth worthwhile when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They are were very poor. The money that I spent on shopping can could help have helped them a lot if I would had not do spent it before already. Little His little grandson tried to help his grandfather, who was 70 years, old by hiring himself out working as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing tell told me shopping is was not enjoyable any more.",4.2,0100_2000_6

"After having thought about this video and asked different various people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take up a great part in of a day at school; this being in three parts. the morning That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all the students come in into the class classroom. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makes made the film.

' In fact, to do shopping can be have some disavantages disadvantages for different reasons: Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin changing room and waste of time putting on some clothes and when in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in a few minutes and as soon as you can regret you can soon regret to buy buying all these those clothes, which you don't really need. Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying them, so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them.

My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result. Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements. I also helped in with the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall. I enjoyed fixing installing the studio equipment in particular.

"I suggest to film filming our English lessons and Math Maths lessons. From the activities I suggest to film filming sport sports lessons. and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always work working, but us as we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial special. It's not true. We practice practise our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math Maths. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math Maths because they think that it's a boreing boring subject. I think it's it all depends of on the teacher. Our Math Maths. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math Maths. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math Maths. For activities, we should film sport sports lessons because we always do something new. We do have many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun.

",,Shopping is not always enjoyable"". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on in our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor neighbour jelous jealous. So, as a conlusion conclusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead.",5.2,0100_2000_6

Nowadays, the people are always buying anythings anything things when maybe they don't need this these things, but only buy them because they is are in fashion. In the first place, when the people think only in about go going to the shopping they forgot forget others other things: play playing with their children, talk talking with than their parents, friends. In the other hands On the other hand, when the people go to shopping they spend a lot of money. I my view, it is more enjoyable do to do others other things than go to to go shopping because, maybe, ""you lose waste your money"".",1.3,0100_2000_6

"Recently we have had a class discussion about shopping. All of the students agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable. Women always enjoy shopping. But a lot of incovenients inconveniences anoy annoy them. So they said they do not always enjoy shopping. First of all the car parking is not convinent convenient and is expensive. Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car. Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher further place then walk to the supermarket. Futhermore Furthermore, when you look aroud around the supermarket, you can't easyly easily find the goods which you want to buy. It's very confusing without the right singho signs. Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket. Otherwise Additionally, men always don't like never like shopping, while. While their wives are doing the shopping they sit in the car or read a newspaper. They would be happy if there are were sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket. They'll Then they'll Then they'd change their mind. Instead of hating shopping they will would enjoying enjoy shopping. In my opinion, nowadays, shopping is not always enjoyable.",3.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition, which I can't believe. I am so excited by the news. I think I can take this opportunity in July because I run my shop all year round except three weeks in July. I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable thought though it may be a new experience. It would be nice to have a chance to try a new sport when we are relaxed. I'd like to try golf because I'm not good at any other sports. Besides golf, taking wonderful photographs of sceneries scenery has been my dream, even though I am a beginner. I'd like to ask about what clothes we need, what the weather is like and whether we need some spending money or not. I'm looking forward to going on this fantastic holiday.

"Dear Kim, How are you? I know you have been waiting for my letter. But as you know, I have been so busy that I couldn't write earlier. Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much. My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try the whole new experience of helping at a pop concert. I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't. I've really enjoyed this opportunity. We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers. We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing. The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience people from the countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most from about this experience? I've found I found pop music so wonderful, it changed my idea opinion of that classic classical music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too. Love",5.2,0100_2000_6
"June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs/Ms Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for the prize I won. My name is Manuel P. Martinez and I won the first prize in your competition. I have been informed that all accommodation and travel cost costs are paid for by the company. I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month. I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tents tent, because I find it more confortable comfortable to sleep in a beds bed, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in a tents tent. I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed practised tried before, that. That means I do not have any experience on the subject. Please let me know the what kind of clothes we will be wearing, would. Would. Will I need to take a suit? Are there going to be any formal parties?

"June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed welcome. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set up the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly worthwhile for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you.

"I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day school day, we should film the large number of sport sports activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm. Only those who gets get good marks can take part in theese these activities, so sport sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry poetry lesson because the Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion emotions they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone.... In my opinion we should film a science lesson, so that our teacher, listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense!",4.3,0100_2000_6

PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES FAMILY (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST). BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN FROM CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS GIRLFRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT SIT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION. PEOPLE, WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF FOR THIS SITUATIONS SITUATION (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE SHOP ASSISTANT, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE). ANYHOW ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOUD SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE.

"Cry Freedom 'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope people and this book could have an influence on them. In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to towards them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in. In other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa. Although Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world. In short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again. Most of all, this book will make you think about the prejudice you have.",5.3,0100_2000_6
"I am writing to thank you for the letter with the result of the competition and also to ask some questions. Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another any other month. The reason for it this, is that, July is the only month in which, I am on holidays holiday so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer stay to stay in a tents tent rather than stay in a log cabins log cabin because I appreciate having straight close contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and as for climbing I used to climb trees, walls, everything in my childhood without falling. Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money would it it would be adviseable advisable to take and what kind of clothe clothing I should take. I look forward to an answer from you.

"I am just writing to tell you about my experience about helping at a pop concert. Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can could talk face to face face-to-face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have had the unique opportunity to take have your pictures picture taken with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves them. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that it is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you your job work and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay for your ticket, it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were not no disadvantages. Kim, summing up, it was the most interesting experience that I have ever had. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

"To: Dinara Safina From: Raisa Re: Daily life at our school. As requested, it I has have collected some information about the school. Below is a summary of the most important relevent relevant points with some recommendations. 1. The fully-equipped fully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly extremely good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are no not enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increase increasing the number of them, because it will be more exiting exciting to film. 2. The school arranges an amasing amazing range of activities, such as excuintions excursions, sports and different kinds of trips. Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the most funny funniest events happen while we are playing basketball and football. I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video. Conclusion. Our school is an ideal place for making a short video. There are many interesting lessons and other activities. I do recommend, however, to make making a short video about a) lessons in the computer centre b) basketball and football games.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. There are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun. You often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress, the most beautiful shoes and so on... They are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to. This It is very nice when you can do your shopping like that. The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but, at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have taken chosen, you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks cash desks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again. Shopping is annoying but also necessary, it. It.

Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years.

"The book Cry Freedom by John Briley is certainly one which will take its place in South African history. Therefore, I think it is a time historical document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again, also by non-South Africans by non-South Africans as well as South Africans. Generations of young South Africans, black, white or brown, will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these those dark years. A - a peaceful man who was caught up in the wills wiles of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force. In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment. It is my firm believe belief that this book will remain a piece work of literature which will not lose its actuality relevance, in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion.",5.2,0100_2000_6

Honestly I had never never had a shopping tour trip which I didn't enjoy when I was alone alone which I didn't enjoy. I can remember one shopping tour trip which I had went on with a man and it was a nightmare. It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows shoes and it is not easy to buy shoes you. You have to choose carefully. I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end in the end we had a big fight about everything. We left the shop without any shoes, in a horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend ex-boyfriend ! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes, which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour trip which was not enjoyable. To sum up, my advise advice is that the women should go alone or with a female friend.",3.2,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays nowadays. In some peoples' people's opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun amusement and they can even get self-satisfaction satisfaction from it. However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO. Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence scene : twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping in a quel queue outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy want to buy a T-shirt? Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be is really an a really annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend friends, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly bad after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable? More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style lifestyle in this new generation!",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Many classes and activities are important in our school. But I have to make a choice in order to select from among them. The class of mecanics mechanics engineering engineering class seem seems to be the more most important lesson. It use uses a lot of technics techniques that we learn in other classes. It gives us the knowledge usefull useful for many school club clubs, like the ""marathon shell"" club or the robotich robotics club. Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier mechanical engineer and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier mechanical engineer. It lets us specify identify our abilities in and the part of mecanics mechanics that we prefer. But there are other lessons very important very important lessons (like English of course!)

After that I will go back to Japan and continue studying at College, but it stats starts at the beginning of August. As for the accommodation, I would prefer log cabins.

I belonged to a climbing club at my highschool high school and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practicing practising centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent of for golf. Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions.

"I think we should follow our time table if we make a video about daily school life, but we cannot film every lessons lesson so I picked up out some interesting ones. Firstly, we should defnitely definitely put the news review lesson in, because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion. Secondly, I think the FCE class should be filmed. Most of us (students) came to our school because they wanted to study English, so it should be the important part. In addition, if we film the class, people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is. Then why don't we film our lunch time because it is also important, isn't it? I think we should film it at the very crowded moment so that people can see we have to wait patiently before we reach our foods food. I think, nextly next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class. For the very last part, why not filming film our faces when all the lessons are finished?",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related with to an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with on an unlimited budget whatever they need whatever they need on an unlimited budget ? And finally who has all the time needed to do so? There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring acquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen arise. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called so-called 'plastic money' is not always safe. Hunting on the High Street high street, or the Shopping Malls shopping malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant can't afford otherwise to buy anything to buy anything otherwise - becomes often often becomes a desperate atempt attempt to reach a living attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consuming consumerist society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' stone age where when money was not even invented. With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits such as overspending, it could lead to serious problems. At the end In the end all everything depends in on our attitud attitude to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products before going shopping. But even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time in through the sales that seasonaly seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms. Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all!",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. You know last month I helped at a pop concert as like part of the security. It was a very good experience. The concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear prepare the scene stage with the musicians. After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and, you know, it was incredibale incredible because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row. There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it. It was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something anything else on the scene stage. I also helped to serve people who would like drink to drink,. I was like a barman. I saw old people, child children.... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting interesting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang, it.

I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at in log cabins, and when I was sleeping I felt some thing something moving in on my skin, then I work woke up frightened and when I openned opened my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at in a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why! About activities, I enjoy most painting painting most, because I am have been a plastic artist since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art. And the other activity is singing. Everybody says I have an excellent voice,. I like to sing when I painting am painting too, it's. It's so relaxing. Is that enough?

I think that bits from the whole school day should be filmed. This will show how the school lives. In the morning prefects make sure that everybody is awake and already up. At the assembly students are told about changes in the timetable and activities for the whole day. In the computing department student students learn about informational information technologies. The main job of the head of the computing department is not to teach but to keep the computers working properly. Maths is the most popular subject in the school. Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons. In the chemistry lab experiments are often set up. The teacher looks after the pupil pupils while they are investigating the topic of the lesson. Meals are very important.

"Dear Sir/Madam, I was very pleased to receive your letter which informed me of my winning the first prize in your competition, namely two weeks at Camp California in the USA. To begin with, I would like to travel in July. This is the only possible time for me, as the school holiday starts on the 29th of June. And from August on I planed planned to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money. Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportable comfortable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not least Last but not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days. As I had have been asked to choose two activities I would like to do during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I get take lessons in it. I just love singing. I would like to know whether there is are some facilities for washing the Clothes. Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily. Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me. Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies currencies to US dollar dollars ? I ask you to enclose include the answer in your reply. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully Mee-Yon Areum.",5.1,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable. When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoires accessories etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be. Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search of for an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends. Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without ""touching"" the others. It gets enormously unbearable in on hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out. Of course, shopping is not always so unpleasant, but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home.",5.2,0100_2000_6
"13 June 2000 Dear Ms. Ryan, I am very pleased to be the winer winner in your competition. I almost could not believe it when I received the letter you had sent sent. I have never won a prize like this. Thank you very much indeed! I am working as a Mechanical Engineer for a well-known car company and I would like to travel in July because this the only month I can use my annual leave. During this exciting holiday I would prefer staying in a log cabin. The reason for this is that I have got a difficulty in sleeping in tents. When I was at the Univercity University university I was very keen on basket ball basketball and I was playing played in for the Univercity's University's university team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque League. Also I am a quite quite a good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to join take part in Basketball basketball and Swimming swimming activities while I am at the Camp camp. There is something I need to ask you ;. I don don't know exactly what is California's weather California's weather is lime like. What kind of clothes do I need to bring with me? Also, what is the currency in California and how much money do I need to take with me? I am looking forward to your reply! Yours sincerely",4.1,0100_2000_6
"Shopping is not always enjoyable. Novadays Nowadays our shopping habits seem to be have changed. I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop. Yes! There was only one shop in the area where I used to live until we moved to Oxford. I was really astonished by all these shopping centers centres, like ASDA, HOMEBASE, ex etc. One day I decided to go to the shopping center centre which is only 40 meters metres from our house. Firstly, I could not find the entrance. I'd walked arround around for about 15 minutes until I found the door. I realized that I'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window. When I entered into the shope shop I was a bit angry. I was holding a peace piece of paper which my mum gave to me. There were written all things I had to buy All the things I had to buy were written on it. But no way! I started looking for the food products written listed on the paper piece of paper but I found only the eggs, milk and bread. Nothing else. So what was all that about?! I wasted 2 hours to buy buying food which you can find in every local shop. Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top.",4.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter with of congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need. First of all, I would like to start with the time of the travelling trip. I would prefer to go to the Camp on in July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August. As regards accomodation accommodation, I would rather choose staying to stay in tents. That is because I am keen on hich-hicking hitchhiking and I amused am used to living in tents. It is quite romantic, I think. As to the activities offered, I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not quite very good at the last one. Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure. As regards swimming, it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now. In the conclusion Finally, I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information. I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me. I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzeled puzzled about what to wear there. Besides Also, I would like to know how much money will I I will need and which expensies expenses will I I will have to pay cover for by myself. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

On the next day I helped them to built build the scenary scenery and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system.

Here are is the information which you asked me for. I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days days off. Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July. I'd prefer to say in log cabins. Because, because our family had some bad experiences with using tents. Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent. It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute absolutely new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in on those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled. Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money for with me. Thanks Yours sincerely",3.3,0100_2000_6

I'm fine either too but I'm quite busy to find finding another part time job after the one, which was the concert supporting the one the one supporting the concert. I remember that you asked me to tell you about that job. It was fantastic but a bit hard! First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office. It was quite terrible when I had to let make people leave, because all tickets were sold out. Then the concert started, I was called from by one of the staffs staff for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next work task I was gives given was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore? It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested in. But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even join enjoy that fantastic atmosphere. What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium. And that mad made the concert absolutely perfect. I wish hope this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together. Stay pretty and lovely! Kisses from",4.1,0100_2000_6

"We know all all know what shopping is. Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable. When you got go to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but there is no more of it it's not there anymore. You, you think that shopping is not enjoyable at all. Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there is are too much many people. You don't like shopping but you must go shopping to eat! But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time ( the girls know what it is ). finally Finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of the time it isn't enjoyable!

"- Shopping is not always enjoyable -. In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actualy Actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion in on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant situation occasion. In fact, the shopping you do for the your daily needs is seldom enjouble enjoyable, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover moreover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need it to, shopping can be a very nice activity. Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all what that I can using ""on-line"" services.

"How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping? Sometimes, they are happy to do go shopping., but why? Therefore, shopping can be enjoyable but it that is not always the case. Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer give some thing something to someone. In fact you try to get a present to make the receive recipient happy. Shopping is also good, when you know what you want. For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport sports shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops. In the opposite On the other hand, shopping can be disenjoyable unenjoyable. Shopping is boring if you go with people who are too fussy. That is to say, they are never happy with what they get and or see. They always find a problem. Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops. It is stupid, they. They do not have any goal. They waste their time. To conclude, I agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable. Even if I like to do go shopping with some people and to some kind kinds of shops I will kill myself because if I waste my time.",3.2,0100_2000_6

It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computer computing, make up make-up, languages, geographie geography, to culture and civilization.

"REPORT ON DAILY LIFE AT MY SCHOOL, FOR MY ENGLISH TEACHER Introduction After our English class' class's decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed. The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings. Best lessons to film As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to film filming Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educative educational and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate sufficient to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard. Interesting activities One event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely definitely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent. Conclusion In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video. Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all students the ones most praised or criticised by all students. INDIAN DEMURO",5.2,0100_2000_6

May be Maybe it is not for you, may be maybe it is you are shopping for a present, but buying things, at least for me, it is the best. But all this power and all this excitement could turn into something that you could start to hate. When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carying caring about anybody, this could get drive crazy to anyone drive anyone crazy. The long queues, close crowded places, hight high prices, sales, all these things conbined combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.

"Needless to say, shopping can cause you a waste of time and money. However, some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable. Those who love shopping are usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping. However, things which you can get by with money do not necessarily fill your unsatisfaction dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be bigger greater. And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners partners. What you want is often different from what your friend wants. Unless either you or your partner is really tolerant, shopping could result in another stress. So it is advisable not to make a friend whose hobby is shopping. In addition to these, everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you how what a silly decision you had done made at the that moment. On the whole, shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh might be extravacant extravagant, lose your friends and have what you don't need.",3.2,0100_2000_6

The singer, who took place performed, wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being a stuff member of staff there, was just amazing. I was just behind the stage. I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so that I could see all that the screaming like made mad crowd crowd screaming like mad. I even saw crying girls, who were trying to reach the pop-singer pop singer. Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly. I think you never realize this, until you're not a part of the crowd. But I'm really happy, that I had even a small role in making helping people enjoying enjoy themselves. I mean, all that those flashing lights, with the changing colours of them their changing colours, I believe they helped much a lot. Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself being to have been very successful. And finally, the greatest news. : I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there. He was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit with his signature on it. I suppose, I will never forget that night. That's about all my news, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

"Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to ask for some queries about your letter which I have received. Firstly, I would like to travel to Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp. Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool, so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that. Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciated appreciate it if you supply supplied some towers towels, if possible. Thanks for your attention. I really look forward to receiving your reply soon.

I helped to guide foreginers foreigners who would like to take participated participate in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England.

"Shoping Shopping is not always enjoyable If you need something you have a choice of to borrow borrowing it from friends or the library, or to bye buy buying it. Let's speak talk about shoping shopping. As in all with everything there are some advantages and disadvantages. Do you think it's an enjoyable way spending to spend of time? If you would ask were to ask me, I prefer my friends to do all my shoping shopping for me. Because, because I am aware of the big lines queues to at the check point checkpoint checkout, crowds of people, noise... And of'course of course not all shops have good conditionering air conditioning. In my opinion the better best time for shoping shopping is weekdays, preferably in the morning. Otherwise, you either will will either not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood, because of the bad maners manners of sales people, that who not every time you ask can give you any advice do not give you advice every time you ask for it. It can be boring, it can be not interesting. Summerise Summarise To summarise all everything, I will would recomend recommend to spend spending less time indoors, shopping during the weakdays weekdays.",2.2,0100_2000_6

"What obviously appears is obvious about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes. Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times things that make our life. To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown at first. It evoques evokes addresses the reason of for our presence here and it is a cliché ; that can not cannot lack. A philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it. Next, students during the pause break in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with between this and the classroom atmosphear atmosphere but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video. Furthermore two moments could have a role. First of all, the arrive arrival of every students student, namely the picture of the school without anybody at first, and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life. Then, the opposite situation, that is to say the scene portrayal of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make provide a parallel comparison.",2.3,0100_2000_6

"A programme is not often good. Shopping is said that to be an enjoyable programme in all situations. However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be. When you go to a sale shop it is dificult difficult to find what you look are looking for without a the help of the shop assistant. The problem is find finding a shop assistant who hear listen listens to your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue queue to pay and many times it isn't possible pay to pay with your credit card and you don't have a any money in cash. So you had lost had wasted have wasted hours to buy buying nothing. You can't talk to the manager even to give him suggestions on how to improve his business, because he is always absent. And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you. To conclude, although you can have good moments times while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, isn't it is it ?",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Report about which lessons and activities we should film. First, I think we can't don't think we can shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks, because this these two elements are representative of a the daily life at school, aren't they? First, we should film some lessons because everybody know knows (or remember remembers for the if they are growns up grown-ups ) that it this is the activity that to be is takes up the most of a student student's time at school. Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily school school day ! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free freely, and there are no teatchers teachers, it. It could be a good contrast to the serious seriousness of the lessons. To come back to a strict the central (a little beat less) subject, I suggest that we film the sport sports lesson, doing. Doing that will allowed allow the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups. Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchers teachers for the students, and for the teachers, to relax, we. We mustn't forget to film the teatcher teacher staff room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchers teachers.",2.3,0100_2000_6

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a statement made of by men in general. Women like to go to do shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands. Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive. Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because the shopping loses wastes a lot of time, which is controry contrary to the tastes of women, because if they have a any free time, they will go to do shopping. I think that a child does not like shopping because he often waits has to wait, and I prefer to play with these friends friends like these.

"Do you think shopping is always enjoyable? Well, it might be true but I think it depends on the situation. When you do go shopping, you can see various products and even very extraordinary thing things. You can also see more graceful and fine thing things. You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you. On the other hand, it usually take takes much a lot of time to get what you exactly exactly what you want. Because, because you have to visit many shops and see many thing things. If the shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are is not interested in shopping.

"Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for the letter which I have received with a great delight and excitement. I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have required requested. First of all, I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and I believe the weather would be best for camping in July. And if it is possible I would like to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I find tents uncomfortable to sleep in. The two activities I would like to do at the Camp are Tennis and surfing. I have been playing Tennis for many years and it is my favourite sport. However, I have never done surfing before but I have always wanted to learn how to do it and I believe this would be my best chance to do so. Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather whether there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies. Also the amount of money I need to bring ( is are there any shops). And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like. Thank you. Yours sincerely",5.2,0100_2000_6

Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers singers and bands whom we will would be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school. When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments equipment for the concert. We were all given different sort sorts of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing practising on the stage.

"I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzing amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good, though probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed disappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrances souvenirs of it!",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. This is true. Some A few days ago my class had a big discussion about shopping. In that occasion On that occasion I hadn't the opportunity for giving to give my opinion about on this task. Now, my English teacher has asked me to explane explain all what I think. In my opinion, nowdays nowadays, shopping is very easy and in the same time at the same time very hard. It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy, shops are plenty full of every kinds kind of things thing. You can chose choose the price more suitable most suitable for you. Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me. Shopping is not enjoyable when you have not enough money to buy what you want, or when you are not sure about what you would like to buy. I remember very well two people who thought very different differently about shopping. My grandmother thought that shopping was a terrible thing, she. She hadn't enough money to buy even the bread hadn't even enough money to buy the bread. My mother, whereas Whereas, my mother was very keen on shopping for everything.",3.3,0100_2000_6

I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in it. I have a medium level of proficiency in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains.

"I like shopping. Some people when they are tired relax by spleeping sleeping, reading a book or watching television, but not me. Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing. I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one in this case. There were are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent spend one hour in the shop whithout without buying anything. However, it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable, for example before Christmas or during some special salles sales. In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm hot and noisy place. In conclusion, you have to know when and where to shop quietly but in my opinion spending money in a crowded shop is the most enjoyable thing in the world.",4.2,0100_2000_6

"SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. I think shopping is a subject really up to date topical really topical subject. I can say that nowadays it is growing up very quickly in our society, like a kind of sport or hobby, as a way to waste or spend the our free time. And it's creating a lot of adict addict addicted people, call called "" shopalcoholics shopaholics "". Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were are looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to for you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms, where you waiting wait stand standing up for your turn. After that, there is the unfriendly and sometime's sometimes unpolite impolite shop assistance assistant who breaks gets on your nerves down. But never mind! the The worst arrive arrives is when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit in because your feet are killing you and you realize you have spent all the your money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable I think most people will agree with that ""shopping is not always enjoyable"". Because, because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time. Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing going shopping. Yes, it is true, this. This is only because nowadays people have more money than even ever before, and some women don't earn money, they. They have no idea how diffcult difficult it is to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will. Will those women still thinking think shopping is enjoyable! So it is depend depends on different the case. For As for me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only never go to shop shopping unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me,. I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you face look at the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do. Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of the times time, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifes lives, they are hopeless. Those are only my opinions, you. You don't need to agree with it them, but one day you might found find out that what I have said is not totally wrong.",3.3,0100_2000_6

Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scence scenery of the background on the stage. As you known know, I like drawing and painting when I have a some free time so that is why I chose to paint the scence scenery of the background. I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice. And I particularly liked the experience that I of helped helping to screen and paint a picture of ""Bon Jovi"" on every T-shirts T-shirt which are was given to the audiences audience. I felt that it was a great time in my life. However, I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand lend a hand next time. Are you willing to give a hand lend a hand next time? If you are, I'll tell you about it in advance. I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do. Best wishes",4.2,0100_2000_6

My two activities chosen from the list are climbing and surfing. My skills in these activities are very different differ widely : while in regarding climbing, this will be the first time I climb have climbed. In ; in, regarding surfing, learning won't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old.

"Dear Kim, Sorry for not having written to you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting writing to you has been the accummulation accumulation of exams during this month. Do you remember that I had to help in at a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did. Did you know I'm one of them? There I got was impressed of by how a singer can cause such histerism hysteria in the teenagers. During the two hours of two-hour concert we had to attend to thirty-six people, who became inconscious unconscious after being trapped in the first line row by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in at a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! avoid it if you can. It's the best thing you can do in this case. Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon. Lots of love. Gil Sanchez",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Report Subject: Video about daily life at our school. Introduction: To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spend spent some time discussing it with other students, and observing and analaising analysing an avrege average day in our scholl school and came have come up with some suggestions. Places to video: We should try to video not only class rooms classrooms but also our playground, cafe, sport sports hall, art club & library. Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are a very important part of our school life. Activities to video: We should show students during their formal studies as well as after lessons. I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the anual annual sport sports turnament tournament or wellcoming welcoming evening for new students. Conclugen Conclusion : To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not to film filming anything longer than 1 or 2 minuts minutes and have having a nice mixture of places, faces and events.

"- SHOPPING - Who doesn't like shopping? Everybody likes it, from a child to an old lady in her sixties, but it is not always enjoyable. When you get home tired after spending all your morning and afternoon at shopping you'll want you want to go to bed because you were looking for only a suit during all day spent the whole day just looking for a suit and you couldn't find the perfect one. The only thing is, we need to know what kind of thing do we want to buy and where could can we we can buy cheaper and more better quality stuff. We have a few possibilities. We can look up in a magazine or a booklet which deliver is delivered with the newspaper weekly. We can order a free book catalogue from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is the internet shops shopping recently so. So you don't need to see long-face long-faced staffs staff in the shops. You won't wait in the quee queue. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer. I think you won't be tired and bored at the end of your shopping on the computer. Think about that way for enjoyable shopping.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Hi Kim! How are you? It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time... Hey, guess what: I gave a hand to helped a friend at a pop concert! It was great, and I got my entrance ticket for free! It happened by chance: I was walking down the street when I bumped into Jane, my old friend, who asked me if I wanted to join her and a couple of mates to help at the concert. I agreed unwillingly, as I couldn't imagine how what a pop concert looked was would be like... but when I came went in I changed my mind! None of the groups were are known nowadays at the moment, but I belive believe they are well on their way to becoming famous bands. My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff, and stay staying there after the concert to clean everything. This was the best part because when everyone was gone, Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers beginners !!! What was a fella guy like that doing in such a place?

I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me He he needed a boy who could help on stage. As you known know, I can do a little of everything so I accepted. I connected wires, I caried carried loudspeakers, and so on. When the show started I was on the stage close to two famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie. Towards the end of the concert I hansled handed a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte. I couldn't believe in it! Poolo Conte asked me to drink with Him. As you know He's he's my favorite favourite singer. We started talking about music and I asked Him him many things about His his texts lyrics, which are beautiful but sometimes difficult to understand.

"Shopping could be fun! Sometimes I like doing it during long Sundays. I like going between colourful shelfs shelves and picking some nice things for dinner or for decorating our house with. I love talking with my mum during shopping, meeting new people or old friends. Sometimes, unfortunatelly unfortunately shopping could can be very annoying, especially at Christmast Christmas or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usually usual. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!) At Christmas or Easter time all shops have usually usually have an unpleasant smell (because of the crowd) and are very noisy! Another period when I don't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then! You cannot breath breathe, you cannot see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper! Next, another not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to. You just cannot refuse resist buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it. In my opinion, shopping could be really enjoyable! The only advice would be: ""Do not do your shopping at Christmast Christmas or Easter time"" - but it will not make any sense, will it? So you just have to get used to it, and enjoy your shopping for the rest time of the year!",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into on their territory. There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into in the crowds, crambled crammed in the small shops during the unique only day-off you have to buy somthing something you like. All this can easily leads lead to a nerve-collapse nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across through the crowds or while you were qeuing queuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you your strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when, despite having been stolen robbed, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry, you finally buy something you really liked like with your credit card and, after having walked a few blocks, you see the same item at half the price in another shop.",4.1,0100_2000_6

If it weren't hadn't been a calm and quite quiet public crowd, we would have had troubles trouble. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room venue were was crowded. So that the concert started an hour and a half latter later late. Everything was all right during the perform performance of the band band's performance, but at the end some espectators spectators came up to on the stage and made did some damage to the band's instrument instruments. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out left immediately, leaving the public without the last part of the show. As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both in of wich which I helped carrying carry things - were appropriate for the concert.

Then, there was only one hour left to install the differents different color coloured lights : ; it was just enought enough time. Thus So, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music music very much, even if I don't play any music musical instrument.

"We would like to belive believe that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life. After working all week, finally on Saturday we can do go shopping. We love spending money, but spending money is not always enjoyable. Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go be confortable comfortable because of the crowd crowds. Why its it's always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundrets hundreds hundred other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods.",3.3,0100_2000_6

Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream. It was an amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland. I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best. Love from",4.3,0100_2000_6

We all have have all been shooping shopping once in our lifes lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we We had a class discussion and we all agree in on some points. For example, if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were are looking for, and instead of buing buying what we came for we will go out leave with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be a waste of time. Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then that is where when the problems begin.

"When I was asked what I do in my free time, I've never hesitated to say, ""I enjoy going shopping."" I'm very extroverted. So I like spend my energy doing sports or some kinds of energetic activity. I thought going shopping was suitable for me. Especially when I visit somewhere for the first time or I have nothing to do, but lots of time, I naturally and automatically look for a decent shopping centre. But nowadays I found find shopping is not always enjoyable. Since I started living in England, I've worked two part time jobs as a cleaner. I can't make enough money for my living expense expenses. I have to control my expenses on the budget. It's not easy for me, as I used to depend on my parents before I came here. Anyway, I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets. What makes me desperate is a nice summer dress I've found in a department store. I really wanted to buy it, but I couldn't afford to buy it.

On In the tale ""It's a good life"", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and uningative. He controls the other people using the power of his mind. Although the other people on in the story are the good ones and suffer with from his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told to us by the author.

"Is shopping not always enjoyable? There are different opinions and points of view. I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food from. For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive. The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants assistants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time. The third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe. Although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch TV than to be pushed in crowded shops, I do not agree. To sum up, I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it.",4.3,0100_2000_6

I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible. Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in a log cabins log cabin. I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days. It's difficult for me to chose choose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball. I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport. I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy. I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional additional information.

The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in with anything they needed done. Firstly, we were asked to clear clean the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing cleaning, some of us offered our help to help to enter bring the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary scenery stage was being prepared for the concert. And then, when all everything was prepared ready, Celine appeared in on the scenary scenery stage to make do some a sound tests check. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests sound check, I went to meet her,. I told her I was very happy for staying to stay to be there and having to have helped at the concert, and I asked her for an authograph autograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me! I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph autograph and the photograph. Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout about the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D. Celine Dion's last CD.

You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart. Apart from the musicists musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service security... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets, the number on them and taking the people to their seats. It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they didn't want to wait for my help; so they went around the theatre, looking for their seats and making so much noise. Sometimes I think that people never grow up, if. If they had been a class of children, they would have made less noise!! Anyway, it was a great experience in spite of these little problems. Now I have to go, write. Write soon and let me know what you have been doing. Lots of love Bianca xxx",5.2,0100_2000_6

"The shopping Shopping is great when you have lots of moneys money, and times time ; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD CDs, whatever. But, it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in a an office, a manufactory factory, a society company, you have the same planning to hours as them. So you just can can only go to do a shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go the on Saturdays but it's badly hard, because there are too many costumers customers. You can't walk, or try clothes on, and it's very hot. The salewomen saleswomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service to give you advice. In England, there aren't paper for make a present. It's different than to the other European countries. Sometimes the sales women saleswomen aren't friendship friendly, because they have are some stress stressed or they aren't the sale feeling. Finally I think, it will be better if the shops stay open until 7.30 pm (half past seven). It will be provide a good service for their costumer customers and be more cool cooler for them.",1.3,0100_2000_6

"This composition is about shopping. People today shops shop sevendays seven days a week with their family, friends etc. But I think shopping is not always enjoyable. This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for producing in the world. The more stuff we buy, the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor Therefore you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports, which is are enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports, which is are for your own benefit good for you. You must think about your children, who would will be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view views in looking at regarding shopping.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Dear Kim, Thanks very much for your last letter. Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month, I'll tell you something: it was fantastic. I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff staff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt like the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it. When we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat. But the most amazing thing happened later, when, ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage backstage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing music was excellent, the public audience enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in on a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always keep it like a treasure treasure it. I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, O.K OK ? Till then, take care of yourself. Love,",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Nowadays shopping is considered one of the most usual and enjoyable activities, especially if you are a woman and you are out to buy clothes. At first sight it is, but shopping is not always enjoyable. Basing my opinion on my experience, I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping. There are some points that give me the reason. First of all, who is your companion? If you take your mum shopping the right day, she has been all day doing housework doing housework all day, that will probably end in discussion argument. In one hand On the one hand, there's you. You are feeling sick, or angry with your boyfriend. How do can you pretend to see in a mirror that anything fits well on you you well ? In On the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, no not having the size for you or too high prices. Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys trips ?

Therefore it must be objective. Then it may improve our day daily life at school. It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at in the final examination. Then I would like to film the computer rooms. Sometimes there is are so much many people that you have to wait half an hour to get one a computer. If only we could get some new ones.

The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of for the same reason as maths that maths is important.

We had a lot of things to do. Acctually Actually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific. After the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule. We had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones.

"Is shopping Shopping is not always enjoyable, is it? We can't say that it is always enjoyable or it is not. Every new day is not the same. But... I think that good shopping depends on ourself ourselves us. If we decided decide to by buy somthing something special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it. Probably, maybe not. Some times Sometimes we have to have deal to deal with not good unsatisfactory service or, for example, could can you imagine it on your way to the shop you have met wrong people meeting the wrong people on the way to the shop or someone told telling you bad news. Or perhaps the quality of your new thing is not so good that as you really expected. Situations The situations are variously various. Maybe you will spend all your money for on a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to a night-club but you are will be short of money. Some people will do crazy things in a situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party. But I want to wish you have a good some enjoyable shopping all your way.",2.2,0100_2000_6
"Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your requests questions. First of all, it would be suitable for me to travel in July only, because that is when I am on holiday from work. Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be unapropriate inappropriate for me. I would prefer golf and surfing. I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent pleasant to do so. About surfing, I am an amateur at it. I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships. Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me I to take take. I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there. Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerately sincerely,",4.1,0100_2000_6
"Dear Kim: Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert. It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it singer fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling whistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader singer, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like About an hour later, he recovered and the show began. What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him. Bye! see you soon,",5.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is a part of my everyday life. I'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food ( monstruous monstrous ) and goes on with to clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely contrary to what you could might think expect, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful stressed because of your children are always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing you see. Your only work task consist consists in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner, for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream! To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage drawback on to shopping: you need money! You'll understand, I'm sure, that why I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month.

"Dear Kim, How are things these days? Sorry not to write to you for a long time. I've been busy preparing for English exams. You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful chance opportunity. As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania maniac. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock on to his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accident accidents so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon! I hope you can go to the next concert with me. Longing for hearing to hear from you. Love,",5.1,0100_2000_6

I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of for choosing this these two activities is that they contrast with itselves themselves each other,. I want one that is more exciting and that asks for more agility and another that is more calm calmer and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on at that it, however, I wish hope that I can learn about it on at the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing at it.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop shops in the center centre of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers sales assistants, what which is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much of time and health. Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there is are smaller crowd crowds and more sellers sales assistants work there. In these days These days people prefere prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping areas centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spent spend the same amount of money.",3.1,0100_2000_6

"When you spend money on goods and services, it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable. There are a few reasons. Firstly, you cannot always get the right one thing although you scour about all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired on your feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially, on the special occasion occasions like on during a sale. Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get robbed by a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that how you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home. In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you. So you would spend more money than you have had expected. To sum up, you should spend money as according to your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable.",3.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best favourite activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do. In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions just like the other women do. When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and it's harder to find it. I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit abandon the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me. And if this is a problem to for me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) should would feel. Often they must go in to special shops to by buy their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life. Will this ever change? I hope so, but, in the meantime, I'm on a diet.",4.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is when human humans people goes go to the shop shops and buy what they went want, however. However, I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sort sorts of things. Anyway, shopping is not always enjoyable as the title states because firstly you will get tied tired because you have to walk out and in in and out the shops. Secondly you will get angry on at the bad treatment manners of the sellers assistants in the shop. Thirdly, if you're fat you won't find you your size. Forthly Fourthly, that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy to too much many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by your self yourself. I think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it, do not go shopping give the money to charity, that. That is better than shopping. For me my opinions on this one In my opinion it is true it is boring, it. It might be because I am a boy.",3.2,0100_2000_6

You asked me to wite write about my the experience which I made had by helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included to clean cleaning up the rooms which were used by the singers and put putting some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and apply make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could stay be at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage backstage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signature autograph. He was fantastic, you. You know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you see saw many stars out of stage backstage. And you might manage had a chance to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money, - not a lot but enough for me. Well I'll have to close now. Give my regards to your parents.

"""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly true accurate afimation affirmation summary in the case of my book because the main character of in the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil manners ways. It's He's the richest character at of all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of for whatever happens to the others other characters. They are always suffering from the revenge vengeance that Heathcliff is swear sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other character characters have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by for his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend tendency to harm but because the others other character characters make have made him become thus like that. This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point aspect of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.",4.3,0100_2000_6

However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping? Perhaps you have an experience unpleased unpleasant unpleasant experience. You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good goods and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover if you bought something then you could find it is a little bit more expensive than the other shop. Both cases are often happened often happen in with shopping. If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly first before going shopping. Then you should check the price and the quality of the good goods.

Also they give have lots of sale sales special offers for on everything, even you can you can even join their club clubs for extra discount. It look looks seems wonderful does not doesn't it. ? But when we thing think about it properly seriously, shopping is not enjoyable, for example, if you forget something that you need for a salat salad. You have to go back to this the supermarket and find the nearest parking space, then before someone takes the their last fresh lemon for your salat salad, you must find out where was is the lemon section the lemon section is, before because they love change to change the store around again and again.

"It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave forget so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie activity always enjoyable?' Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh strength that practising doing a sport or even going to work require requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite quiet and relaxed activitie activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by with the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie activity, it is also true that it is definetly definitely not an enjoyable one.",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Shopping can be painful As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situations experiences I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink. It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts. Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble undesirable pains. Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake risk. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as there's nothing better than shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces.",5.3,0100_2000_6

"Making a short video about daily everyday life is an enjoyable but difficult thing to do. We would should concentrate on students students' imagination imaginations, creation creativity and talent talents. to To do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes. Effectively, in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes. However, it is important to observe students students' attention and therefore we should film them during an exam (but only for a short period of time). A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that short shots close-ups should be taken for of each subject. Students walking and talking in corridors should be filmed so that we also show how students relax between two lessons. I think these this are is the best advices advice I can give and hope that one you understands understand the main idea, which is to concentrate more on students students' attitudes than on lessons.",4.1,0100_2000_6

"Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy, we. We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful. While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie gypsy. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's its accesories accessories and besides also clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop.",5.1,0100_2000_6

Some people when they are in a sadness sad, they will go shopping will go shopping when they are sad to forget every thing everything and the fact is that every body everybody knows how to shopping shop. If you have chilldren children, you will know it very well that when you are busy doing something and the chilldren children see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometime sometimes they even cry or shout to at you and it is really anoy annoy annoying you. However, they are happy after once they have it. Anyway, even in families they usauly usually have this problem that when they bought buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem that about where the old one is going to be and that is the begining beginning of an argument between mother and farther father or parents and chilldren children.

For example, the teacher of history and polish Polish language is able to interest students about in the subject in differents different ways. According to students' oppinions opinions, the most popular activities are the basketball, tennis, swimming and as well also the photography group and the painting team.

It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 4,000 seats for the "" spactetors spectators "" if you can call them like this that. Can you imagine? There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping sweep clean. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer transfer move some equipment. The musicians brough brought it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound sound quality. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff is worth? You don't even want to know. Apart from these this, we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared prepare for the concert. They had to chose choose their clothes, and give do one last performance rehearsal before the big night and everything had to be perfect! Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained I gained through from it!

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". Before we can give our opinions on this statemant statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about. 'Shopping' stands for means buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about luxuary luxury goods. In this contest context, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look at on it as a duty. But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with much more a far greater consiousness consciousness and more joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look at on it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour of approach to shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internet Internet and use e-business and online-shopping online shopping to order your pants for example. This is even an appropriate a good way to get around the unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home after before you have ordered order them by e-mail! Another solution way to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop. You have been presented with some causes reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it making it more fun. It depends on every individual to change your mind and act behave as like a 'smart' shopper.",4.2,0100_2000_6
"Dear Mary, I'm really happy to hear from you! I've had so much work at school recently (exams!) and so many things to do, that I've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit. Fortunately, the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones. The boat trip you're you were asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there. There were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you: The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours. I think such a tour is essential, because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle. After visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant, but you'd better take a picnic - it's so beautiful there! In the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake. Try windsurfing, you'll have lots of fun! I'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it. Especially that because the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount. Try it and have fun! I'm looking forward to hearing from you, take. Take care,",5.3,0102_2001_12
"It was three o'clock in the morning when the phone rang. I rushed to answer it, but when I picked up the phone, there was nobody there. ""Stupid teenagers again"" - I thought angrily, climbing the stairs to my bedroom. Suddenly, I heard some a strange sound behind me. I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound disappeared had disappeared. I began feeling to feel a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had this the impression that something was wrong. I stopped and listened. Nothing. A complete silence. After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again. There was nobody there. But something changed had changed - the kitchen door was wide open. Suddenly I saw a figure of a man, dressed in black, moving towards me. I couldn't believe my own eyes, so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister's room. ""Jane"" - I shouted - ""There is a ghost downstairs! A man, dressed in a black suit!"" ""I know"" - replied my little sister peacefully, - ""It's Grandpa. Don't you know it's his birthday today?"" ""Yes, but our grandpa is dead, don't you remember?"" - I cried. ""That's right.

"Dear John ! I was very happy to receive your letter. I haven't heard from you for a long time, how. How are you? How is your sister, Marine? I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable interesting. We were also very lucky with the weather, ; it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long. I think you should definetly definitely go and I'll try to help in what any way I can. First of all I recommend you to go go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the your questions. I think you should take a packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle). I advise you to try the watersports water sports as well, it's. It's a real laugh. I'm not sure how many students are there there are in your class but they give reductions for groups of over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you. By the way, I'd love to come with you, if it's possible! I really enjoyed our trip and I'm eager to see you again! Looking forward to your reply, Love",5.3,0102_2001_12

But can each one of these people answer one simple question ! ? ""Could you live without television for a week?"" I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary on the other hand when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived for three weeks in a complete TV vacuum in a complete TV vacuum for three weeks,. I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings. You might ask me a normal question : ""What about the news?"" Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget have you forgotten about newspapers? And the radio (if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them it to be read to you!) The biggest difference the absence of TV had made made in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say ""no"" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiate appreciate it and your life a lot more.",5.3,0102_2001_12

If not, pleas please let me know. I'm sure we will find another solution. It's very kind of you to let me use things in your flat. I'm over the moon!

""" junk Junk food instead of a carrot"" Young man, are you aware of what you eat and drink? Are you sure that your diet is healthy enough to help you grow up ? In today's fast moving fast-moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home, especially children, parents take care of them and always prepare some a good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper. However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or and fibre usually finish on ""McDonalds"", and hamburgers or Bic Big Macs. Moreover, very often the school canteen doesn't offer diversified varied types of food, like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and or in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal - and even if even though the times were worse poorer, people were more sensible. In my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as and they should work on their lifestyles and keep their head.",5.1,0102_2001_3

First of all, I think I'm going to be busy on the 4th of April. Can we change the date into to the 5th of April, at 4 o'clock? Thanks very much for letting me use your things during the my stay. I may need to use particularly the computer and the CD player. Is that OK for with you? By the way, if you tell me around what time you will be back on the 20th, maybe I can prepare something for dinner. I know you're going to be too tired to cook after 11 hours of flight flying. Last of all, thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present. Anything as a souveniere souvenir would be quite enough for me. I'll leave it to you. I know you have a good taste in presents!! Have a great time in the States. Love,",4.2,0102_2001_3
"To whom it may concern, With regards to your advertisement in ""The Traveller"" magazine, I would be pleased to tell you why I want to apply for this trip. The first thing that caught my attention in the advert was ""... eight people from different countries... "". I am very interested in meeting and spending time with people from other cultures. I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too. Obviously a sailing trip has not got the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting. I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real life world and having friends from all over the world will help me to think "" worldwide globally "". I hope this letter will be enough to explain why I want to do this trip. Yours sincerely faithfully",4.3,0102_2001_3

We lived stayed in at my aunt's house who which was in the center centre of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there is was a house with a swimming pool, garage and garden.

They went into the house through a window. I though thought it was some rubbers robbers. I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone to the police.

"I agree with this statement. I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time. A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed. In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life lives of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far. For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion instance we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death. On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous, it one has to accept also the disadvantages of be being famous. The famous Famous people must enderstand understand that the journalists are doing their work job. In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be being annoyed for the rest of the holiday. In conclusion I think that there must be more compehension comprehension understanding and respect between famous people and the media.",5.2,0100_2000_12

"What do famous people wish want ? Do they want to be famous and ignored? Or do they want to be persecuted buy by the media? There are plenty of good things about being famous. You do not have a precarious life. You are rich and be-loved beloved loved. Of course, it does not mean you deserve to be persecuted all the time. Perhaps we could call it the "" rough of the smooth "". However, to have his your photos photo taken and showed shown on television and in the newspapers increases your popularity. It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame. I might also miss be missing the point. You might be a Princess princess, a politician or a footballer ; but are not doing it for any fame. You were born with the talent, sometime sometimes or with the title.

The construction will be more simple, what which will give us a feeling of balance. More houses will have gardens, what which will make us feel closer to the nature. Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen, which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside. I do not think so.

"Some people think that to be being a famous person is a very excuiting exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well. I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory he must be tottally totally sure clear about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed chosen their careers, ; they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation, and they will be not not be considered trustworthy. Another succesfull successful carreer career such as, film stars must also be balanced. If somebody is a film star this mean means that he has got a different kind of life, a more comfortable, more interesting life but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star. If somebody wants to be famous of cource course they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the there are limits. Everybody deserve deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer career or job you are follow following have. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself. And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life lives of everyone and not trying try to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people.",3.1,0100_2000_12

"I believe that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for some reasons. First of all, they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrity celebrities. Therefore, they should deserve to lead a normal life as we do. Secondly, noone no one has the right to look at snoop into anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the our human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of to privacy. To sum up, famous people are the same as we are, and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into intrude on their privacy. Therefore, I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.",5.1,0100_2000_12

"A DAY OF IN MY LIFE It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again.

First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done made organising our this good excellent programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement.

"I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than it a home is now. In the future, our homes will have incorporate the most advanced technologies. Computer Computers will take play a an important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in via the computer we would buy will be able to buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in on our computer. We won't have the any necessity need of going out leaving to leave from home, because the computer will give us everything. Although computers will give us all the material things, it they could will not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That Those things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love..., that kind of things thing will never change. In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life living conditions will approve improve, and the computer will be very important for us, but is it won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of in a home = have, that. That will be the same as now.",3.3,0100_2000_12

"Why the medias media are are the media so interesting interested in famous people? Because of us! I know that everyone is excited about what happened to at Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of The the United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit to too far. Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. ? It must be very exhausted exhausting to have the medias media around you days and nights day and night because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character. In my opinion it there should be a rule which let lets the medias media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe.",4.2,0100_2000_12

"Being famous and risk rich rich and famous is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes at some time. But not always famous people are famous people aren't always happy of with their condition situation. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: ""I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do. "" There is no surprise to this answer This answer is no surprise : famous people can not cannot have their own private life. Whenever they go out they are suddenly ""hounded"" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They can not cannot even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph. But the worst thing of all is that they are often the victim of malicious gossips gossip, which most of the times time are is not even true. In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly tight right that famous people accept their condition situation, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings, on. On the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life as like all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed depressed : not always, in fact, money and celebrity being bring in fact, money and celebrity don't always bring happiness.",4.1,0100_2000_12

"Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing following them all the time. Famous people have always been the center centre of interest for a number of people. Their wedding weddings, their holiday holidays, their new haircut haircuts and so on. But do we think enough about the right to have a private life? We can watch consider this problem from two different points of view. From one side On the one hand, this these people chose to become public people figures. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do go into politics or the movies! But, from the other on the other hand, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be being disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities extremes. In conclusion, I would say that both parts parties, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules. As public people, stars and politicians have to accord allot some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful.",4.2,0100_2000_12
"Dear Mr Robertson, First of all I would like to thank you for the chance to do make such a gorgeous trip. We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the Museum museum and the Gallery gallery. However, there is one point that we would like to change in the programme. We are interested in visiting ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" during our travel trip. The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make up make-up, and also the leisure and sports wear. Furthermore it is totally free for students. All this these exhibiots exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence in on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it. We think that we could go there on the next 14th of March, in the eveninng evening, instead of going shopping. This one could be translate move moved to the 15th in the evening. It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we are totally agree that we don't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum. We truly believe hope you will consider our change. Please contact us if you have any question. Yours faithfully sincerely,",4.1,0100_2000_12

"Nowedays Nowadays famous people don't have an easy life. They are always attacted attracted by naughty journalists, which have a aspiration desire to earn big money for writing an extremaly extremely good report, or article. To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips gossip about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly true. In addition we are fascinated in by their marriage marriages, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known well known. By When chosing choosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look be like what their life would be like. On the other hand, their life has no privaty privacy. In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxiously anxious and lonely. They are always under high great pressure in their every-day everyday life, because they are afraid of being recognise recognised. Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions politicians and films-stars film stars belong to the public. In conclusion, I belive believe that we have a right to be informed about their life lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.",3.2,0100_2000_12

"A PRIVATE LIFE All people have some difficulties about with their job jobs but some of them have more than the others. Reason The reason for this ; is that they are famous and everybody wants to learn know about them. Having a private life is important for everybody. I think, people want this. if If you are a famous person, for example a singer, film star, politician or well-know well-known footballer, you haven't get got any choice. Because people want to learn about you everything everything about you., so journalists are following follow you all the time. I know, they are not like us. They are famous, but I think they need to be alone sometimes. They nead need to be with their family in silence peace. This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them, too. I think the media must be more understanding. We don't have to learn know about their every second. We have to remember that, they need a private life like us. We can love them without disturbing them too.",4.2,0100_2000_12

"Story It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get got back from the school. I always had my own key and unlock unlocked the door by myself. It was a horrible day, the day I had left left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, noway no way to contact with my parents. What I decided to do was getting to get into the house by climbing up on the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, beause because I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippy slippery ! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully, so as not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house. It was a scary, but thrilling and exciting incident!",5.1,0100_2000_12

"My dream It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim in the middle of with sharks. I lived in a small village on the ocean. My father was a captain on a huge boat. When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbours harbour to harbours harbour. I grew up through the water world and I couldn't live whitout without it. Once I was fishing, when sharks came appeared all around me. I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them. Since this famous experience, I dreamt every night about that about that every night. One Saturday I got on into my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me, thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks. I had done what I had never expected to do.

"Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life. However, in my opinion, famous people, such as politicians and film actors, deserve to have a private life. First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life life private, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and or a family member's or the closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to be have monitored their feelings their feeling monitored at that time. Another reason that I agree that famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was the ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi paparazzi when she was dating with a guy man, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death. To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life their private life to be revealed on in public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.",4.2,0100_2000_12

"(FAMOUS PEOPLE, SUCH AS POLITICIANS AND FILM STARS, DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME) FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC, ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION. AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ACT BEHAVE IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND OF FOR INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAYS HOLIDAY. THIS SITUATION AFFECTS FAMOUS PERSONAL LIVES PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY PRIVACY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS, THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE FAMOUS THE RIGHT THE RIGHT OF THE FAMOUS TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES IN SECRET.

"For famous people, having a private life is difficult, especially because we are all interested in their lives. On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous famous they will be. According to me In my opinion, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider think that some stars sometimes call journalist journalists to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement publicity. Moreover, according to me in my opinion, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview interviews that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television, either in the newspapers or on television, that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it. On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have are under to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph photographer. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up make up disguise themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is of their temper, a regarding to or out of regard for their children. Nevertheless, they are never let left alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what which we often forget they are.",5.2,0100_2000_12

You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it them. Why? Because he especially concentrates on the history, social life society and politic political situation in of the time the story is played set. That might can be quiet quite complicated difficult to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books writes books especially for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him! I've send sent you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments. I hope to hearing hear from you soon!

"In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle centre of the public attention. They are always expected to be beautiful, intelligent, good-looking. This is very stressful. That's why it's very important for these people to have a private life without journalists where they can relax and where they don't need to be superstars. To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars or and politicians have a right for to it one. Otherwise they can get suffer soul problems, and fall in into deep depressions depression. I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example, all 24 hours in a day, and the all all the things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is are your friend friends your friends are, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with.

That It is in the central Central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is only all about fashion: the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up make-up and hairstyles. I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students ( what which is really good). It is a great opportunity because this show is only each every two years and normaly normally it is difficult to go in. And, as you know we all are interested in fashion. In my opinion, I would suggest to go going to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or, going to the show on wensday wednesday Wednesday morning and on in the afternoon, we can choose between free time or the National Art Gallery. I look farward forward to hearing from you.

When I arrived in the street it was dark, and windy, but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street street opposite. By the time I arrived here there, he has had disappeared. Suddenly, I felt very tired and decided to go home. My sister was standing, crying and showing the front door. I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her. I finally realized that she was dead.

This kind of people are known as paparazzi. it It is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not, they. They just try to find the best pose. After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them, they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission. This is the most argueing arguing arguable contentious point. Do they have to ask for their permission or not. ? However, if they would ask asked, obviously they can not cannot could not take the kind of pictures, which show them naked or when they are having a shower. May be Maybe they would have to pay for this these kind kinds of pictures. On the other hand, famous people have a point, if they do not allow the paparazzis paparazzi to take their pictures. Because, because, althoug although they are famous they have also also have their private life. Unless they do not want to share it, it this must be acceptable accepted by for us we must accept this. I think the best example would be Lady Diana.

"Do famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time? Some people think that they should. They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity privacy and freedom in their lifes lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymus anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to go out leave home in order not to be recognised.. This is supposed to make them happier... Nevertheless, if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of the people, if. If they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity, a popularity which has given was given to them by all us. So they need to become famous to be what they want and if the people don't know them, they are forgotten, they die... To sum up I would like to say that for me it is very difficult to decide which group has the reason is right but, by for the moment, we should try to respect each other and go in the other's soul to feel like them in those moments we cannot understand them.",4.1,0100_2000_12

We lied lay on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley volleyball matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing of at me. So I took the decision to go and join them also as well if though I knew that it would have been be dangerous for my life. I walked waded very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends could would understand realize that something was wrong with me.

There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homes home might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and the risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery.

Not only because she's famous or and wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce caracthers characters or and how to tell a good story us though decieving deceiving the readers. One of her most interesting and famous work works is a novel called ""The Orient Express"". It's a detective story, like all the stories written by her. In our words In other words the story is settled set on a train wich which tooks takes a trip along the orient. On the train, all the passangers passengers seem to be involved in a crime. This is such a fasinating fascinating story or and it's the way Agatha Christie tells it. The mistery mystery is kept drawn out until the last page of the book.

I have already read the programme, and I agree with like that it, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to on the River river trip to Greenwich,. Also, they can visit the Science Museum, and they can going go to the shopping, on. On Wednesday 15 March they are going to visit The the National Art Gallery, really, I think that is a good programme. However, I think as well, that the class would like to visit ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" that the class would like to visit ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" as well, it is on Tuesday from 10.00 AM am until 19.00 pm. They don't need to pay. In addition, I think it is a good a idea, because they could go after afterwards shopping shopping afterwards, when they have a some free time,. I am sure about that, they will like want to visit that place. However, the The programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody. Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand and accept you your personal opinion as well. I look forward to hearing from you.

"12.12.00 My personal opinion about famous people, is that their lives are good in one way and bad in another way. I think that they live their life like hat that, because they want to live this life. They doing do everything just for money, and sometimes, they can make theirs their life easier than they it would normally do be. It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalist journalists following them all the time, however this news publicity give gives brings them money, and a confortable comfortable life. Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, they live happy happily, because they know that the being famous mean means to be being rich. They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be a very good peaple people, because "" the Famous Fame "" is just for a few short time, nothing is lasts forever in this world. My personal opinion is that, I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well. I do would not really like will be to be a famous person, because you are not really yourselfh yourself, and for me that is the more most important thing. Your Yours faithfully",3.1,0100_2000_12

I would also like to tell you that it is a very interesting programme event because it includes all the latest fashion fashions about in leisure and sports wear and make up make-up as well as hairstyles. It is a great opportunity for us because the fashion is fashinating fascinating and free. I should would be more very grateful if you could change the programme so as to allow us to go to the show.

"All the people have the right to have a private life without others other people to disturb disturbing them and following them all the time. The journalists Journalists follow the famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take fotos photos and get other information about them. After that the journalist journalists sell their information in to the newspaper newspapers and magazines in order to earn money. I thin think that it is very dangerous because the famous peple people cannot have you a private life and on the other hand consequently they may suffer from deppresion depression and sadness, which may be lead them to suicide. I think that the goverment government have to protect them and their private life from the journalist journalists, by punishing them journalists. I think that the government I is responsible for the private life of the people. All the people have the right to live free freely, without to be being disturbed by other people.",2.3,0100_2000_12

"Much safer but still at home Our homes have change changed with many comfortable things compare compared with the past. As many inventors made lots of things, we can live in good facilites facilities well-equipped houses: But do you think no more comfortable homes will be built? Our homes will be different in the way order to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security safety like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That is means, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what migh might still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is a an instinct that people prefer comfortable place places and want to take a rest in a peaceful place. To conclude, while our homes in the future will be much safer than before, they will still have good spaces for us to be at home.",3.1,0100_2000_12

"""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is was knocking at your door every day. It was 20 years ago and we were had been friends since we were 10. In those days we decide decided to be friends forever and work for the NASA. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done. The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas). Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it so. So, that, we decide to access our school school's Main database and change our test results. This way we could obtain seldom rare places at NASA university. The task was not easy, with at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there. There was nothing to lose. It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding hiding all our fingerprints. The operation operation was successful. Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system systems and new encryptation encryption algorithms.",4.1,0100_2000_12

"""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time."" Nowadays, most people think that famous people have a so such such a good life ( with lots of money, comfortable house houses etc ) that they have to stop complaining about he the media's treatment, because they have chosen to have this kind of life. On the one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the audiance audience public, and soon so on. Moreover, especially for with film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the Tv TV or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their fame careers. However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographs photographers all the time. You can't go outside quietly in peace, and there is all the time always a crownd crowd of people who stands stand in front of your house waiting for you. The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have all the time people around your house people around your house all the time who are watching at you or people who are following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this. That is why I think that famous people deserve a private life, like everybody else, and that journalists should not follow them everywhere.",4.1,0100_2000_12

"I It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I remember when I was in secondary school. At that time, my friends and I was were so daring and full of energy. One day before an exam, we were so excited and frighten frightened because we weren't ready for the exam. We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk. One of my friend friends came up with the idea that we had to steal them. The question was who would be the person do to do to perform this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me. I was so scare scared and frighten frightened because if I was caught I would be punished. However, I had to do it otherwise my friend friends would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it. So, that afternoon in at lunch time lunchtime, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely quietly and calmly. Finally, I was succeed successful in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it back without anyone saw seeing me. That was the most scarely scary and daring thing that I did in my childhood.

"Ourdays Nowadays, with the help of the media, famous people, like a politician politicians or filmstars, plays play an important rule role in our community. It is also normally, true that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially from regarding their private life. Who got married, who got divorsed divorced or who had has experienced a remarkeable remarkable changing change of in his complexion, these are questions, who that most journalists are interested in. But what kind of life is it, when you even can't can't even go to a restaurant because you being are afraid of, the journalists, who will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people diserve deserve also also deserve to have a private life. It is a right like that everybody from among us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. Is it It is normally normal when you are a star, that everybody wants to know all about you. We shoudn't shouldn't forget, that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media! I think nobody have has forgotten, where the curiosity from of the journalists end ends leads. For example, there was the hunting about of Princess Diana and his her friend. I hope that they will be punished for what they done did !",3.2,0100_2000_12

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. The survive survival of my family depended on me. We were a poor family, living in one room for five persons people five people living in one room. My father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children. We haven't hadn't enough money to buy food, or new clothes and the worse worst was that my youngerst youngest brother was terribly ill, and without money we couldn't bring take him up to a doctor. So, a one day I decided to steal rob the bank. During For weeks, I had prepared my programme plan, trying not to forget something anything important. Everything was ready and me I was too. So I knew that the day after would be the good right one. I get up got up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had founded found a little window at the back of the building, so I entered by in this way and by chance I just arrived in the monney money 's money room vault. I hadn't never hadn't ever seen so much money. I took it, the most of possible and went out by the same way. I ran to my house and went back in to my bed for sleep to sleep a little bit.

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to try test my limits for once again. This is my nature. I had to see how far I could go this time or, to be more specific, how high! I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumpping pumping in my vains veins, full of adrenaline, tolet to let myself free, to shake, from excitement. There These were my thoughts when I first saw the advertisement for a "" Sky Dive skydive "". I didn't hesitate much. The same afternoon I picked up the phone and I gave them a call. That was it. The following Sunday I fint found my self myself on a plain plane flying 20000ft from the ground. When the time for the jump came I had some second thoughts.

"""THE HOME OF THE FUTURE"" From any my point of view In my opinion, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will has have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights of in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa. Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an a UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very important great, they will probably consist on of making the houseworks housework easier. The cleanest clearest example is to compare a house from the beginings beginnings beginning of the 20th century with our house houses. Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. In On balance then, I think that the houses that we can see on in films won't really exist.",4.1,0100_2000_12

"To be famous or not to be famous? Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame, like not to have having a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just think imagine that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just only simply with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these the paparazzis paparazzi. On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for. It is the way how they earn money, of course. But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going go too far sometimes to take get a picture. For example, Lady Diana. Do you think she would have been still would still be alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these those nosy paparazzis paparazzi ? Well, this will be is an open question to anyone.",5.1,0100_2000_12

"Hello I'm going to write about ""The Home of the Future"". We can't say straight away for certain how the people's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create the unbelievable incredible things about future life life in the future. Of course there will be differences between todays today's homes and the future ones. I think the houses will grow up on from twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy it them. I think more and more people will have at least one flat, ; it doesn't won't matter if you are rich or not. The rooms will be designed in a future futuristic fashion like, where there will be less furniture and everything is will be compact, even. Even TV-set TV-sets will be on the ciling ceiling. The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you can will have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even be able swiching switching to switch on the light by saying only simply ; : "" light Light "". If course if you have enough money to let your self yourself live in such an apartments apartment, then you can afford it. Now what's going to be the same. ? Well as I said, if you're poor, the government still give will still give you the a flat but a very ugly one, probably with rats in it. The same problem will be with homeless people who doesn't don't have money at all, even to buy a food for themselves. They will have to stay on the streets as the streets is are their home.

"How will be our future homes? What will our future homes be like? Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason of for all of this things thing is the impressionable introduction of the ""new technologies"", such as Computers computers, the Internet or WAP technologies. Of course, this these new facilities technologies will be introduced at home. Now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by the computer, and this opption option, in the next few years, will become the most common once one. The new technologies probably will will probably produce a considerably considerable revolution in some essencial essential parts of the house. For example, we will have got computerizated computerized ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have got central heating controled controlled through the Internet from our office. Despite all of this these facilities, there are some home activities that will remain the same, fortunately. Who don't doesn't like to prepare a cup of tee tea with traditional kettles, waiting for the boiling watter water water to boil ? And to read the newspaper at breakfast instead of watching TV?

"Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and beside aside from the fact that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else. Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or to just a little privacy. I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for authopraps autographs. Like, like in the zoo. The biggest commercial gain in history, I believe, but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way. On the other hand, they must have done something to become famous. It may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected connected to it. To sum up, I believe that everyone has the right to keep the privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve deserves to have a private life. Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers, journalists and photographers, famous people will just have to get use used to this living ""under a microscope"".",5.1,0100_2000_12

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Last summer I went to the amazon Amazon on an expedition with other 10 10 other people, : such as a guide, a doctor, a scientist & all the rest of us as like me were just curious. We walked all day and took rest rested in the evenings. We were not allowed to leave out our tents during the night or until the day start starts started, because of the dangerous animals which leave live there. But for me it was the most exciting moment. One can be really amazed by the view. One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without being seen and started walking towards the river, because I want wanted take to take some photographs of the sun rise sunrise. The view took was taking my breath of away when suddenly something took my breath away. It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as if she it was very hungry. I knew I could not do make any moviment movement for my safety but I did and for to my surprise It it run runs ran away.",4.1,0100_2000_12

"I believe that everyone in this world have has curiosity. We're We always want to know about others' life lives, especially the famous - one even the one ones that we hate. But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for. For example, when we get married or when a policeman stop stops us on the highway, we don't want any stranger notice to notice that what is happening to us. Famous people are also the normal people like us just. Just because their jobs are known by every people everybody, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy. They also want to have some special time with their family or their friends. It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take taking their photographs, and some journalists write the news reports that are not true. We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people. But it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time, they. They should give them some privacy. On the other hand, these stars should accept that they are famous people so everyone wants to know about their life. The best way is if they, the famous stars and the journalists, should compromise and respect each other's rights.",4.2,0100_2000_12

"We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people the media's treatment of famous people. Of course I must agree with the opinion of my class - mates classmates : famous people, such as actors, singers or politicians, deserve to have a private life, but of course it is not always like this ! Almost Most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere and all the time, looking for a great news story or interesting pictures to put on the first front page of the newspaper, and I don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just becouse because they are popular. Anyway, this is not always necessary necessarily a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, becouse because it let lets gets people talking about him and increase increases his popularity. In conclusion, I can say that this is not the bigger biggest problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse because I am not famous!",3.2,0100_2000_12

"Famous people, such as politicians and Film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists Following them all the time. I think that they have a right because, they are also people like me or like you you or like me and they should have a private life. Private A private life is very important to for anyone everyone, because your job create creates you stress and you should rest, and charge recharge your batteries For the next day. If journalists are following you step by step your every step it is difficult to have a private life. On the other hand., I believe that Journalists are doing their work job, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and they are always. Following following the Famous people in order to discover something new of about their lifes lives. Another thing is the pressure. From from media owners and the difficulty For someone to Find a job in our these days. Media owners want to maximize their profits and always press the journalists to Find something new. To conclude journalists should doing do their work but without annoyance annoying to the other people.

"We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebreties celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, what which makes their life miserable. The first point I would like to make is that a the private life of a celebrity is open to the public. I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely widely discussed in the mass-media. It is common knowledge, that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family. Another aspect is that the children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention. They can't communicate with ordinary children and or attend ordinary schools. And last, but not least, is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, show showing their real feelings to the public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering into in their lives. I would like to sum up by saying that every person, either whether famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed.",4.3,0100_2000_12

"Who would like to be famous? Are you dreaming Do you dream of being a Star star ? It must be wonderful when you have a lot of money and everybody seems to know you. Really But is it really ? I think the main problem is that you would lose your private life. That's the price you have to pay nowadays. But you need all the journalists to become famous so the only way is to accept that there are journalists and that they are just doing their job. No one told you to be famous. If you are famous, it was your choice and therefore it is a the price you have to pay. Of course you have fame and poverty. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on in the street. To sum up, I think, if you are well-known well known you have to deal with that. There's no other way.

"Since always, medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worst worse and worst worse, you can find everything in ""gossip"" Newspapers newspapers. Does Do famous people deserve to keep their own private life secret? According to me In my opinion, you can't don't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when you to start start you your career you know that the medias media will be hunting you everywhere and the more famous you get the worst worse it is going to be because that is the life style lifestyle people wants want to know everything about, for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they They saw them many time times on T.V. or in the Cinema cinema,. So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever, it's because you like to show yourself. therefore Therefore, even if I agree sometimes the Medias medias media are going go too far and write really bad things., if you're famous you cannot have a private life because all of this is a part of their your job. And if the Medias medias media are too awful they have got the law to protect themself themselves.",3.2,0100_2000_12

"Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are always followed by journalists. Do they have to give up their private lives? First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well-known well known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others. Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandales scandals usually increase their fame, even if they did do anything something wrong. On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded on, as they are the same as us, human beings. It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life.

"Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. We know it does not matter whether they are famous or not, ; everyone has deserves his own some privacy. However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious. We like to know and chat about gossip. This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep into their private lives to satisfy us. There Therefore, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them. However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but because morality and priciples principles are also being are also concerned. Of course, it if everyone pays paid less attention or interest, the situations situation should would be better. I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died dying in the car crash was one of the most disarster disaster disastrous examples. Although we can not cannot deny it is our nature - we are curious, - we can improve our sence sense of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them.

"The private life of famous people! Who have has never dreamed of to be being a famous singer, sportman sportsman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so big great that they are known all over the World world. I think that this these kind kinds of people have a poor life because they never can can never be quiet because all the poeple people everybody know knows them and want wants to know a lot of things about them. They have always always have to be careful about what they say and what they do. In my opinion I think I think that if famous people is are always followed by journalists it is not the responsability responsibility fault of the media but of the huge quantity number of people who are interested in famous people people's life lives. Firstly, because it is this is because there are a lot of "" scandale scandal magazine readers "". Secondly, it is because they have a lot of admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams to dream and see what a "" star star's life"" look looks like. In conclusion I think that people who are to too much interested in other people people's life lives have not do not have an interesting life and are unhappy!",3.2,0100_2000_12

"Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. In these These days, when we can see a picture of a famous person almost on every first page front page of the on the front page of almost every newspaper, it's a quite quite a common topic. First of all, I think that famous people deserve to have a private life. Journalists should not follow them all the time, trying to make get an interview or taking take an 'interesting' picture. Secondly, I can really understand how annoying or depressing it can be. I think that deep inside famous persons people are just ordinary people and like for all of us, having a private life is important for their psychological condition. On the other hand, we could say that they decided to have such this kind of life. Maybe they need to pay the price for being rich and popular? Maybe sometimes they need to sacrifice their privacy? In conclusion, I think that it is very hard to find an answer to this question. However, everyone needs to have keep some part of his life being a secret.",5.1,0100_2000_12

"In the next few years the people's home homes will be changes changing a lot. First The first point is we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication telecommunications or the internet Internet. In the future they both getting closer and closer. That means for exampel example, while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll control your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or chees cheese. Or, never without living leaving the office, you are able to heat the wather water for a hot bath. So in fact people's home homes became will become more confienence convenient and comfortabler more comfortable. I think also housewifes housewives will receive more help with a robotor robot in the household home. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furnitures furniture of people's home homes will not change as well either.",2.2,0100_2000_12

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Whenever I recollet recollect it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go to into the Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going to into the Army, I was able to apply to join the Korea Auxiliary Police. One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul. Suddenly, the theft signal burglar alarm came into on. So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly. When we arrived at the place which where it happened, one man started running away. Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow. Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg. He fell down and we had to stare at each other. After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him. As a result, I could go on vacation.

And mostly, it should be a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost anything at all for students. But the only problem for with the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00.

"The Home of the Future. Have you ever thought about our future home? Living in a high building! But we could have everying everything we want to. Home might be a mixture with moden modern styles and a natural view appearance as well. These days a lot of contries countries have been worried about lands that can't have enough place space to build houses. The prises prices for lands land are getting increasing it's because of this reason. So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of home homes are going to be in a building like a flat. Maybe it is right say to say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lest least 20 Floors. It means the Japanese are planning for the future home. But what my imagination I imagine is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school. Because we are living in a computerlised computerised life, so we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well. But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in there them. And because it'll be a big building we'll be able to see a whole great view through the window. In conclusion, our future home will have a natural view appearance like these days today's home homes and give people a new technological home life.",2.3,0100_2000_12

I have a few suggestion suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in. We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show. Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show.

"Everyday Every day, something changes and we become more modern companies. Companies use computers instead of books, dentist dentists use modernized electrical electric item tool tools instead of just a pair of plier pliers, even. Even homes are effected affected. From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves, but. But we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and these those things now new to use us will be old, outdated and changed. I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers controls. We might even be able to open the door without getting out leaving from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door. Although all that may change happen our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size sizes should remain as it they was were and the living rooms and all everything may still be decorated in the same style. We might still favour like that old carpet and couch. The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount number of rooms should not change too either. In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc discs. Never They never have They will never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles utilities we are will be using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other else with the same purpose. Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen cuisine, it. It will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't miss give up the great taste of food although. Although it could be subsituted substituted to with a vitamin pill or two. Lastly, I think that all this these changes won't really be noticed as we change it things daily and slowly instead of abruptedly abruptly.

This is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich. We also enjoy like the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus. It seems it's going to be a great fun. I do not know if it is possible to make any change changes in to this plan but we saw an ad in ""Time Out"" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convinient convenient - March 14 -, and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there.

"Although human humans is are a social creature creatures, all people need an area in which they to be able can to stay stay be away apart from other people. This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life. Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others. It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit. Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though ; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. Press The press takes this demand as an order, and ""but the public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people. In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend too so much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quiet quite sure, that even the ones, who have chosen their occupies occupations just to be famous, don't like to be pictured photographed when they believe they are alone. The situation much must be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this it. Obviously, there is no point in saying ""famous people have a right to their own live life lives."" Although this statement is absuletely absolutely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will have keep to keep living with journalists.",4.2,0100_2000_12

It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV, and go to shows, and sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things can not cannot give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world that to pay buy will buy that.

Finally, after chasing being chased for a long time, she was dead killed because of in a car accident. It must be a good example of a media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However, she definetely definitely deserve deserved to have a private life as one of a citizen. Human right rights must be existed exist for all people. On the other hand, there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media.

"Thinking about the media's treatment of famous people, I've realised of some things. On my point of view In my view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad. The media's media are looking forward to create creating great expectations about famous people. They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public. On the other hand, if the media's media are acting in that way it is because of the society. The society Society it is It is society who that increases the audience of the media, if nobody gave paid attention to the famous people people's private lifes lives, this treatment would finish. But in my opinion, before you get famous you know which what are the consequences. As in another you may know what could happen. To sum up, there is no job perfect perfect job, and be being famous involves a lof lot of money, but also a lot of jouralists journalists following your private life.",3.2,0100_2000_12

Undoubtedly, their the first enemies are ""Journalists"". Some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories stories in depth. Because, because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives. Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved. On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely an intrusion on the their privacy. What is more, they insist that before as well as celebrities, they are also human-beings human beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched.

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a new challenge, and not only for me, but for everyone there. Nobody thought I was capable of doing it. I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me, was driving me mad. Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge. I could listen hear the crowd shouting 'Go, Go go '. That was my only chance.. Only a few more seconds, otherwise my time turn would be over. I didn't even think of boking looking down. I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all. Then, by some 'strange power', my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it, but it was too difficult. The clock was running.. tic tick, tac tock... And suddenly everything stopped. I felt an enourmous enormous peace. Somehow I managed to jump out of the airplane and I was flying! Those minutes, up in the air, feeling the wind in my face, were fantastic....And then I was terrified when I couldn't open the parachute! Fortunatelly Fortunately, I wasn't alone.",5.3,0100_2000_12

I was having a holidays holiday with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited from by some locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy of about having such an a especial special opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared. In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't had have this possibility the chance to do this and the family where we were staying with, kindly boiled the water for us. We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was find fine, but on in the second week I got very seek sick. I think it was the water.

Some days later we went back to Dehli and, having being been to the doctor and having again drunk bottled water, I was feeling healthy again.",4.2,0100_2000_12

"The discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the a controversial one. There are people from both side sides of the agrument argument who have strong feelings. There is evidence that a reason why these people's life lives should be advertised focused on by the media. Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened happens to them. In addition, their life lives may be the a good example for other people to follow. Sometime Sometimes, many a lot of people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate imitate imitate the person who they admire. However, there is are other some disadvantages that we should consider. Firstly, the famous people would like to do anything they want to without being concentrated focused on by the media. I think it would is be annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance behaviour would be known by the public. Eventhough Even though, the famous people can be the a good example, they should be the bad habit for public. A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, For for example, buying the clothes that famous people wear. The reason that why they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life. To Prevent prevent many a lot of people from copying too much we shouldn't inform them of all aspects of the life of famous people. I agree that the famous people people's life lives should be in private. It is the of benefit for to themselves and the public.",2.2,0100_2000_12

"Almost everyone hates other people gossip gossiping in about their private things lives. It's a natural reaccion reaction to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping about you and bothering your personal thoughts. So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or films film stars, don't deserve being to be followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time. I thing think that the journalit's journalist's journalists' only aim is money, be cause because they know that if they publish famous people's private life lives they would will earn lot's lots of money selling the magazine or the newspaper. But they don't consider the problems the romours rumours may bring to cause the famous family or couple. Sometimes the journalit's journalist's journalists' aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil the a politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous. In conclusion, no matter which or what the journalit's journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private life lives just as normal people have do.",3.3,0100_2000_12

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to hit a human being and unfortunately, although I respect every form of life, humans, animals and plants, I managed to hit a burglar. Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt at in hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed. While I was listening to my favourite cassette, I heard a strange noise. Immediately I opened my door and... I could not believe my eyes! A short man stood was standing in front of me! Without any warning, he pushed my arms. I shouted as I pained it hurt. I realised that he was very strong. But I was faster and more intelligent than him. I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found one a hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him. To my relief I managed to survive!",5.2,0100_2000_12
"Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you about for the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially because of the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an advertisment advertisement for ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go and see it. First of all, you might not know what this show is about. In fact, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up make-up and hairstyles. It would be interesting for us to see all that ""live"", rather than on TV. Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget. The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the Science science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move on to the show. It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while. We all hope you will be able to find a good solution without causing too much trouble. Yours sincerely,",5.1,0100_2000_12
"Terror in the Alps It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. We had been trapped in the snowy, almost vertical slopes of the ""Tête Blanche"" for more than ten hours by then. We were there, alone, my friend with his broken leg and myself. We had decided to climb that more than 3'700 3,700 -metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that the 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly immediately see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone mobile phone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped! I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood stayed where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which where we were able to call a helicopter. We were safe!",5.2,0100_2000_12

"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Otherwise I had to keep walking untill until the train start started. Have you stayed at in a park during the night? When I did that, I was traveling travelling around Japan. It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto. Although I intended to stay at a youth hostel, I could not find any place to stay, and also it was too late to buy a train ticket to go back home. It was a windy spring day. I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossam blossom tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moon light moonlight helped me to see the things. I was regretting I risked having risked staying at in the park alone. Suddenly, a strong wind blew up the thousands and thousands of pieces of flowers petals. It was like a dream. I saw the pink colored coloured snow there. Sometimes when we risk a great danger, it turns into a great experience.",4.3,0100_2000_12

"Freedom! Nowadays the main attroction attraction in the newspapers and on television is the private life lives of famous people. It is really interesting how people like knowing to know about famous people people's life lives. Without someone famous know knowing, photographs photographers take pictures secretly, and try to get money on for it them. Sometimes being famous can get stress stressful, because everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions of questions. Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing things in a public places, because nobody like likes seeing famous politicians or film stars without asking questions. On the whole, to be being rich and famous don't doesn't always bring happeness happiness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous.",2.2,0100_2000_12

The London fashion Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday. It's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions exhibitions of the latest fashions, of the new hairstyles, and of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to apply make up make-up. Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon. By In this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion Show. Thanks for the your attention and we're waiting for your answer.

"Famous People x & the Media Famous people are special for in the eyes of the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways means of communication so they need more information. The media is starting to get encroach into the private life of these famous people. It's important to respect other people people's lives because it can cause serious problems in for the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity privacy the media has to respect that. Everybody likes to be with your their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around. In summary, the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar family problems or personal problems. The respect Respect is essential. They deserve to have a private life like any common ordinary person.",3.3,0100_2000_12
"Dear Mr Robertson, I would like first, in the name of on behalf of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London. We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to, is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them then !... well Well actually we've must just received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance admission is free for the students so that won't raise the cost for of the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were to go going shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind! I hope you will take account of consider our request, Yours faithfully sincerely,",5.3,0100_2000_12

I had to react!... otherwise I would have felt responsible for his death, for the rest of my life. George was leaning lying on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood. He had just been beaten by a ground group of white men. And yet, he was too weak to resist the rats, coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death. He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner prisoner.

"Dear Mr Robertson, On the behalf of On behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose to for us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of the English culture... However, we would like to suggest you something: A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which seems to be very attractive interesting. Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there. Let me explain to you what it is: It must be is an exhibition which takes place in the ""Central Exhibition Hall"" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different leisures leisure, make up make-up and so on... What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more very interesting for us as fashion is a of great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us we nor you would be against the sacrifice of a ""Shopping-Afternoon"" - that we can even put have on Wednesday during the our free-time free time - so that we are able to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show... Please, Let us know. Yours faithfully sincerely",3.3,0100_2000_12
"The respect of Famous people's private life lives has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to like us in the way that they had a childhood, thy they got married and built had a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing, which is literally a ""public job"". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"", such as politician or actor, is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox : Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree say yes whereas others would desagree disagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question... As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice decision to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's It's as simple as this that ! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences predicament so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a ""public job""?? Even if anyone everyone deserve deserves to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate moderate what they write in order to respect altrui's other people's privacy; since they would probably not be glad happy to have their own private life revealed exposed ! But to solve this problem, we may must think first about its origin... ""Reading the gossips gossip "": isn't it what anyone all of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui other people in his privacy. Why not? To conclude, I would say that ""privacy"" and ""celebrity"" can't go together. It's just a matter of choice: being aware of that problem, everyone is free to become famous or not... !",4.2,0100_2000_12

"The Home of the Future The future is unexpectable unpredictable and human beings are afriad afraid of dangers, such as tornado tornados or earthquake earthquakes. Thinking about home like as a place to live, is not already worth. We must think about home from other another point of view. We need to make our home a place where we want to come back to after the work or school. It has to be a pleasure to be there for us. What we really need in the next millenium millennium is love, that is what will keep all the family together and forever. Do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture? No ;, I do not think so. Live Life is too short to think about the poscesives possessives possessions.

For example, if you look back into to the forties and compare the home homes then with nowadays, you can see that it they has have become more modern, especially the facilities equipment in the kitchen and in the livingroom living room. in In the future it could be is possible that you don't won't have to prepare your breakfast by your yourself own, perhaps you just have will just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone off. In addition to this, you may have some roboters robots bringing the newspaper at to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping. and maybe Maybe they are also will also be your living life patners partners. The place to spend the night will still be the bed. The livingroom living room won't get see any big changes, although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult complicated.

"In the year 2000 the media is one of the most powerful things on the planet. The media is everywhere, televisions television. Television, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines all have one goal, to inform the citizens. Some of them, however, are not doing their job probably. They don't inform people about provide people with news, education or documentaries. They just published publish gossips gossip about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars. I believe all the people, famous or not, deserve to have a private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us, with their problems, their good and bad times, and of course they don't want to be publish to publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is would be right.

"Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I am being the representative of my class to thanks thank you for organising a good programme in London, especially the visiting visit of to the Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and we can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in the National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited this these two places before. So we decide decided to choose the other another programme event which have seen as an entertainment. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show is will be hold held at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions, including leisure and sports wear. In spite of these this, there is are also make up make-up and hairstyles, which attract girls most. Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it holds is held for only 1 day, which is Tuesday March 14. And, it is free for students. So I think it is worth visiting. Personally, here is are my some suggestions about how the programme could be changed. We can join follow the programme that you planned as usual and then we go to that fashion show on Tuesday. Finally, the above information is my opinion and I hope you can accept it. Thanks for your kind attention. Your Yours sincerely,",3.3,0100_2000_12
"How is the home of the future will be ? Remain Will it remain the same, as usual or have a great difference ? For me, I think people's home homes may not be built on the ground. The home homes will be built on in the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the home homes is are will be built on in the sky. It, it will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is will be used. And, there should be a an a electrical robotic servant in everyone's home. So there's there'll be no need for people to do the household work housework. There should will be no beds at home because some pills are will be invented to make prevent people not prevent people becoming sleepy. If you're tire tired, the pill can give you vitamin vitamins, protein proteins and make you refresh refreshed. For Regarding electrical goods, there will be no any will not be any kind of electrical products product except computer computers. People will do anything everything on the computer, including watching TV, listen listening to music, and chat chatting with people. As, as the computer is being as a multi-functional products product. on On the other hand, there're some ways things that remain the same. The toilet should remain the same as people need to use it daily and nothing can replace it. Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful joy and fun. Since friends and family members won't change and or replace be replaced, by anything. These are my imagination imaginations. I really wonder how the home of the future will be.",3.2,0100_2000_12

"General Generally speaking, homes will change considerably. They will become less dark and more confortable comfortable than today. People's homes will build be built more economically by using natural energies energy like solar or wind energy. This These improvments improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling non-renewable energies energy. About the size of hous house houses, I think that in cities houses will be more and more little small because of the over population overpopulation. We also will will also see very high tall buildings which contains contain a lot of narrow flats. In opposite In contrast, in the suburb suburbs or in the land countryside, more and more rich people will build big houses. Homes like this will be build built with the latest technologies and will be very luxurious. But about the differences between the rich's and poor's homes homes of the rich and poor, they will be the same in the futur future. New technologies and facilities won't improve the relationship between people. I think that people will be as alone and julous jealous as today.",2.3,0100_2000_12

"Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed been changed considerably by rapdily rapidly developing mordern modern technology. To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods wood to warm a room up and make food. Since the eletric electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life lives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many much times time on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an and off the light the light on and off. Machines, such as a the dish washer dishwasher, laundry machine washing machine and remote controller control help us jut just to relax or do a little work necessary necessary work. From my point of view In my opinion, people's home homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised built in into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting connected to the owner. He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".

It was a nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine have decided decided to go for on holiday this year to the see sea side seaside. We thought that with that beutiful beautiful weather the seeside seaside is would be just perfect for relax relaxation, sunbathing and joy. However, the truth was a little bit diffrent different. The things Things started happening from the first day we arrived. The weather had changed suttendly suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain. Despide Despite of that we were still thinking optimisticly optimistically. We were thinking is so many other activites activities to relax and enjoy ourself ourselves then sunbathing on the beach. We went to a few Exhibitions exhibitions, night clubs nightclubs, and restaurants around the area and we really had a fun. In the end, the weather got better, so we decided to go to the beach. Everything was showing suggesting, today was going to be a good, sunny day. We went for swimming. Then again in a few minutes the weather changed and a strong big storm begun began. The sky went completly completely black, so at first it was difficult to see, where everybody is was. I look looked around and I relised realised one a friend of mine is was still in the see sea, and fighting with against the storm, trying to get to the side shore. I didn't think.

First there is a show with the latest fashions, after they show us the leisure and sports wear sportswear and then there are the make up make-up and the hairstyles shows. The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of to the show is free for students. You see, the programme has only only has to be changed on Tuesday morning.

"The Home of the Future Now, we are in the 21th 21st century. Most of us live in houses or flats and it is most mostly very comfortable. But in which what kind of homes will people stay live in the future? What will be different and what wont won't change? We can will need our imagination for answering to answer these questions but we will never know the right answer. I have further ideas :. In the futur future, maybe in 2113, there will are be houses like now but only with more technical things. The life Life at home will be more easy easier because a refrigerator which fill fills up itself itself up or a bathroom which clean cleans itself. So, people wont won't have to clean their houses because there are will be a machine for all the works work. But I think that people will altough although also need a bed and a table with a chair. These things and a lot more went won't change or wont won't be forgotten.

"The man Man is a being that need needs to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him himself. As well as this he needs his own free space and privacy. This is also as important to him as friendship and family. In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press. Just, just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The yellow press is searching for every little bit of information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people, just to take a picture of them on to show how they eat or with who whom the they meat meet. The photos will be on in tomorrow's press and so rumours are born. On the other hand the these people have choose chosen to walk on this path. Everything in life has a price. The price for fame and money is the lost loss of privacy. First of all you have to give up something for getting to get something else. However, the press shouldn't create rumours and hunt those people like animals. As well as this, the stars shouldn't complaint complain at any time about their fans and their lost loss of privacy. They wanted to be famous and the they had known knew the price before beforehand. The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous.",5.1,0100_2000_12

"Famous people. What does it means mean ? From my point of view In my opinion, these are the people, who stay all the time in our sigh sight in our sight all the time. We are intrsted interested in politicians's politicians' and film stars's stars' wear clothes, hobbys hobbies, passions and the intrigues. The There are lardge large numbers of the journalists following them all the time, even in there their private life. In my opinion, each human being has a rights right to be free. We can go for a wolk walk, go shopping, go to the cinema, get marrige marriage married or devorce divorce divorced. Why famous people couldn't can't can't famous people do all this these things? Why everybody must must everybody know and tolk talk about their private life? The most important thing is that the famous people are also normal people as like us. They live as like us, they brief breathe and eat as like us, they even following follow fall in love as like us. I think, they must should have a normal, private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them appearing in the different newspaper's newspapers' curiouses.",1.3,0100_2000_12

"The Home of the Future Dear Reader, I have decided to describe my home of the future or, in other words, the place where people will live in 100 years. Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will obey respond to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers, which will control every thing everything, every item of furiture furniture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programm programme them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they just will will just stay in their rooms and study from on a computer, gaining some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, caps cups will be washed and cleaned washed automaticly automatically. It is possible that only one computer will do this all all this and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.. This will be your home, another member of your family and your house or flat together as well. This is my opinion vision of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it.",5.1,0100_2000_12
"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to your advertisement article which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction to with your article. First of all, your advertisement article mentions that the course had to be cancelled, because the teacher was ill, but the course cancelled was cancelled only on the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that no body nobody registered for the local history course. So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses are concerned, it is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for being these courses these courses being so popular is that people are very interested in these kind kinds of activities. Apart from this, the teachers was were very experienced and the equipment was particullarly particularly coteporary contemporary. Furthemore Furthermore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention. Finaly Finally, I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention bud but I would like to thank you for you your kind attention to my letter, and I would like you to write another article which will lit to tell the truth Yours faithfully,",4.3,0101_2001_6

In my opinion, as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place job in a restaurant. If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to in the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder consider which working place workplace is more convenient to for you. You'd do better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum may include big tips from the tourists. Apart from these this, despite the fact that it is a summer job, you could be employed for the whole of next year, if you are lucky. Last but not last Last but not least, I hope you will find my opinion helpful. I wish hope your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's about a problem.

If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear to you that the invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives. For example, all infrastructures, such as public transports transport and power stations, are ran run using computers, the government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids kinds of services institutions and businesses, such as hospitals and supermarkets, use them as essential capitals. In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers. So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important. From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool. It improves the productivity of my homework, that which is involves often often involves essay writing, and also it allows me to access to the internet Internet. Since I live abroad, the internet Internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend best friend and when I want to know what is going on in my home country.

It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed become a necessary condition in some professional activities. Trades, politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs. However, the common average man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student. It becomes then then becomes a real obsession for the average students student, as e he uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations...

Television is a good way to be informed with about the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers, ; it's more relaxing.

Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment.

"To In my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing things which has been invented in is a the car. Cars take play a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn are learning how to drive and choose choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper compare compared to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on at a bus stop on in a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being be stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack track repairs, you. You can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto to your favourite station and have a plesant pleasant drive to your distanation destination. Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this. From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay rely on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a some quality of life for my daughter and myself. Since I passed my driving test I can not cannot understand how I used to live without a car before. I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly absolutely love it!",5.2,0100_2001_6

"' Where are you? ' is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone. Why? Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever. The mobile phone. Once heavy, expensive and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers. Due to the mobile phone., communication has changed, not improved. Of course it allows us to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) ). For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. ? Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. ? It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing dialling home to ask which salad to buy. ?

Also there are performances which helds are held daily in at the front gate of the palace.. Final Recommendation. It is out of question It is out of the question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history. You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea.",5.1,0100_2001_6

If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television. "" Televisions Television is just an amazing invention."" My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make let us know more about the world without travel travelling it all. If there are were no televisions, we won't wouldn't know what are were the other countries the other countries were like, or even what language they speak, unless we go went to that country. Secondly, for in some points ways, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially specially made for children, such as ""Learn follow me Follow Me "" and ""Be good to others Good to Others "". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know learn what I should do generally or how to behave nicely well when I was still a child. The last but not least Last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments entertainment. Maybe you will think think that playing basketball, and going to cinemas and discos are much better that than staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't.

"Could modern people live without a light bulb? Well, I don't think so. Only The only people who could live without it one, must would be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation! We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly ever happens! Well, unless there wasn't is anything something wrong with the power supply. I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in the toilet, all the light lights was turned went off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would can be, and I was sure I can could never, ever live without it one.",5.1,0100_2001_6

For example, I can travel to many a lot of places in the U.K. Especially, since I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so on how I could go shopping, go to college and so on if I hadn't got a car ? In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go pass past my village but the bus fares is are very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes a long time to go somewhere. The car has largely significantly affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than by use using public transports transport. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, which as I brought some cassets cassettes with me from Thailand.

It has been was in her parents' appartement apartment. The neighbours had come came into to make their calls and to get their calls. Todays Today nobody could imagine such a situation. In every household there is a one telephone at least. There are a lot of advantages for to it. Firstly, people are able to talk to a person on at every any time.

Moreover we always can can always call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor call the police, the hospital or a doctor for help. This could save your life! An other Another advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it. Of course there is also a big disadvantage. All people know this situation ; : people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion decision how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone.

Recently the computer is has become really necessary and we can't manage to work without them. Not only is for bussiness, but also in for my life. For instance, when I want to contanct contact with to my friend, it's quite helpful by using to use e-mail. Before the computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact with to foreign countries at the same time. And also it's time to make new system systems which makes us use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computer computers more than before. Despite Being an amazing invention, some times sometimes the computer makes causes a big problem, such as the millennium bug (some people called it the ""2000 problem""), because computer computers are not flexible enough like a human's brain. However, the computer is worth to use using in our life until a more coveniance convenient machine will be is invented.",2.2,0100_2001_6

"Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined. People do not have the impression on important inventions any more, because they have been getting more popular and common. However, there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extreamly extremely important invention. This is electricity, invented by Edison. From my point of view In my opinion, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines, appliances and equipments equipment which are used in modern times can be operated with only only be operated with electricity, which makes people not to do too much phisical physical labour. What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity. In my life, I use electricity in many different ways.

"The telephone, a blessing. Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in over for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance application was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could can imagine life without it. Take me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say ""Sorry, I must cancel our meeting"", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it? Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on. Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so. So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention.",5.3,0100_2001_6
